<h3>PAINTING ON VELVET.</h3>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">UMEROUS</span> inquiries have been addressed to
us for some instructions in the elegant art of
painting on velvet, and we have at length prepared
an article on the subject, which, we think,
will satisfy our readers. Papers on ornamental
work are exceedingly useful, when, by the aid
of practical experience, they convey simple and
precise directions which can easily be learned.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe43" src="images/i_393a.jpg" alt="Flower and Leaf Pattern" />
<div class="caption"><p>Formula 1.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among the various accomplishments of the
present day, no fancy work is perhaps more elegant,
produces a better effect, and is, at the same
time, more easily and quickly performed, than
painting on velvet. Possessing all the beauty of
color of a piece of wool-work, it is in every way
superior, as the tints used in this style of painting
do not fade; and an article, which it would
take a month, at least, to manufacture with the
needle, may be completed, in four or six hours,
on white velvet, with the softest and most finished
effect imaginable. Another recommendation
greatly in favor of this sort of work is, that it
does not require the knowledge of drawing on
the part of the pupil, being done with formulas,
somewhat in the manner of the old Poonah
paintings, except that in this case the colors are
moist. If these formulas be kept steady, a failure
is next to impossible.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe43" src="images/i_393b.jpg" alt="Flower and Leaf Pattern" />
<div class="caption"><p>Formula 2.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The first thing necessary to be done, after obtaining
the colors and the velvet (which should
be cotton, or more properly velveteen, as most
common cotton velvets are not sufficiently thick,
and silk velvet, besides the expense, is not found
to answer), is to prepare the formula for the
group intended to be painted. Get a piece of
tracing or silver paper the size of the cushion,
mat, or screen you wish to paint, then lay it
carefully upon the group you wish to copy, and
trace through. Should the paper slip, the formula
will be incorrect; it will therefore be well
to use weights to keep all flat. Having traced
your flowers, remove the thin paper, and laying
it on a piece of cartridge paper the same size, go
over the pencil marks by pricking them out
with a fine needle, inserted in a cedar stick.
Now that you have your whole pattern pricked
out clearly upon a stiff paper, take eight or nine
more pieces of cartridge paper, of the same size
as the first, and laying them one by one, in turn,
under the pricked pattern, shake a little powdered
indigo over, and then rub with a roll of list
or any soft material. The indigo, falling through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
the punctures, will leave the pattern in blue spots
on the sheets of paper beneath; then proceed in
like manner with the remaining formulas until
you have the selfsame pattern, neatly traced, in
blue dots on them all. Next, with a sharp pen-knife,
you must cut out the leaves, petals, and
calices of the group, taking care to cut only a few
on each formula, and those not too near together,
lest there should not be sufficient room to rub
between the spaces, and that, for instance, the
green tint intended for the leaf should intrude
on the azure or crimson of the nearest convolvulus;
for it must be kept in mind that in
this sort of work erasure is impossible.</p>

<p>The foregoing diagrams will show how the
formulas should be cut, so as to leave proper
spaces, as above mentioned. The shading denotes
the parts cut out.</p>

<p>Some leaves may be cut out in two halves, as
the large ones in the pattern; others all in one,
as the small leaf: but it is chiefly a matter of
taste. The large leaves should, however, generally
be divided. In each formula there should
be two guides&mdash;one on the top of the left-hand
side, the other at the bottom of the right-hand
corner&mdash;to enable the formulas always to be
placed on the same spot in the velvet. For instance,
as in Formula 2, A and B are the two
guides, and are parts cut out, in Formula 2, of
leaves, the whole of which were cut out in
No. 1; and therefore, after No. 1 is painted, and
No. 2 applied, the ends of the painted leaves
will show through, if No. 2 be put on straight;
if, when once right, the formula is kept down
with weights at the corners, it cannot fail to
match at all points. Care should, however, be
taken never to put paint on the guides, as it
would necessarily leave an abrupt line in the
centre of the leaf. While cutting out the formulas,
it is a good plan to mark with a cross or
dot those leaves which you have already cut out
on the formulas preceding, so that there will be
no confusion. When your formulas are all cut,
wash them over with a preparation made in this
manner: Put into a wide-mouthed bottle some
resin and shellac&mdash;about two ounces of each are
sufficient; on this pour enough spirits of wine
or naphtha to cover it, and let it stand to dissolve,
shaking it every now and then. If it is not quite
dissolved as you wish it, add rather more spirits
of wine; then wash the formulas all over on both
sides with the preparation, and let them dry.
Now taking Formula No. 1, lay it on the white
velvet, and place weights on each corner to keep
it steady; now pour into a little saucer a small
quantity of the color called Saxon green, shaking
the bottle first, as there is apt to be a sediment;
then take the smallest quantity possible on your
brush (for, if too much be taken, it runs, and
flattens the pile of the velvet; the brush should
have thick, short bristles, not camel-hair, and
there ought to be a separate brush for each tint:
they are sold with the colors). Now begin on
the darkest part of the leaf, and work lightly
round and round in a circular motion, taking
care to hold the brush upright, and to work
more, as it were, on the formula than on the velvet;
should you find the velvet getting crushed
down and rough, from having the brush too
damp, continue to work lightly till it is drier,
then brush the pile the right way of it, and it
will be as smooth as before. Do all the green
in each formula in the same manner, unless there
be any blue-greens, when they should be grounded
instead, with the tint called grass-green.</p>

<p>Next, if any of the leaves are to be tinted red,
brown, or yellow, as Autumn leaves, add the
color over the Saxon green, before you shade
with <em>full green</em>, which will be the next thing to
be done; blue-green leaves to be shaded also
with <em>full green</em>. Now, while the green is yet
damp, with a small camel-hair pencil vein the
leaves with ultramarine. The tendrils and stalks
are also to be done with the small brush. You
can now begin the flowers: take, for instance,
the convolvulus in the pattern. It should be
grounded with <em>azure</em>, and shaded with ultramarine
(which color, wherever used, should always
be mixed with water, and rubbed on a palette
with a knife); the stripes in it are rose-color, and
should be tinted from the rose saucer. White
roses and camellias, lilies, &amp;c., are only lightly
shaded with white shading; and if surrounded by
dark flowers and leaves so as to stand out well,
will have a very good effect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe40" src="images/i_394.jpg" alt="Frame of Deal" />
</div>

<p>Flowers can easily be taken from nature in
the following manner: A A, D D, is a frame
of deal, made light, and about two feet long, and
eight or ten inches in width. The part D D is
made to slide in a groove in A A, so that the
frame may be lengthened or shortened at pleasure.
A vertical frame, C, is fixed to the part
D, and two grooved upright pieces, B B, fixed to
the other part. These uprights should be about
nine inches high, and C half that height. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
is also a piece of wood at the end A of the frame,
marked D, with a small hole for the eye, and
there is a hole in the top C opposite to it. S is a
piece of glass, sliding in the grooves in B B. In
the hole H is placed the flower or flowers to be
copied. If a group is wished, more holes should
be made, and the flowers carefully arranged.
The eye being directed to this through the hole
in E, it can be sketched on the glass by means
of a pencil of lithographic chalk. It is afterwards
copied through by slipping the glass out,
laying it on a table, and placing over it a piece
of tracing-paper. When traced on the paper,
proceed as before to make the formulas.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe25" src="images/i_395.jpg" alt="Wire Frame" />
</div>

<p>Of course, so delicate a thing as white velvet
will be found at length to soil. When this is
the case, it can be dyed without in any way
injuring the painting. Dye in this manner:
Get an old slate-frame, or make a wire frame;
add to it a handle, thus; then tie over it a network
of pack-thread; next, cut a piece of cardboard
the exact size of your group, so as completely
to cover it, the edges of the cardboard
being cut into all the ins and outs of the outer
line of the group; then placing it carefully
over the painting, so as to fit exactly, lay a
weight on it to keep it in place. Then dip a
large brush into the dye, hold the frame over
the velvet (which should be stretched out flat&mdash;to
nail the corners to a drawing-board is best),
and by brushing across the network, a rain of
dye will fall on the velvet beneath. Do not let
the frame touch the velvet; it should be held
some little way up. Then just brush the velvet
itself with the brush of dye, to make all smooth,
and leave the velvet nailed to the board till it
is dry. Groups, whether freshly done, or dyed,
are greatly improved, when perfectly dry, by
being brushed all over with a clean and rather
soft hat-brush, as it renders any little roughness,
caused by putting on the paint too wet,
completely smooth and even as before. Music-stools,
the front of pianos, ottomans, banner-screens,
pole-screens, and borders for table-cloths,
look very handsome when done in this
manner.</p>


<h3>INTERESTING DISCOVERY AT JERUSALEM.</h3>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> following, from a letter dated Jerusalem,
May 16, 1853, has been sent by Mr. James Cook
Richmond, for publication. "I was spending a
couple of days in Artas, the <em>hortus clusus</em> of the
monks, and probably the 'garden inclosed' of the
Canticles, when I was told there was a kind of
tunnel under the Pool of Solomon. I went and
found one of the most interesting things that I
have seen in my travels, and of which no one
in Jerusalem appears to have heard. I mentioned
it to the British Consul, and to the Rev.
Mr. Nicolayson, who has been here more than
twenty years, and they have never heard of it.
At the centre of the eastern side of the lowest
of the three pools, there is an entrance nearly
closed up; then follows a vaulted passage some
50 feet long, leading to a chamber about 15 feet
square and 8 feet high, also vaulted; and from
this there is a passage, also arched, under the
pool, and intended to convey the water of a
spring, or of the pool itself, into the aqueduct
which leads to Jerusalem, and is now commonly
attributed to Pontius Pilate. This arched passage
is six feet high, and three or four feet wide.
Each of the two other pools has a similar arched
way, which has not been blocked up, and one of
which I saw by descending first into the rectangular
well. The great point of interest in this
discovery is this: It has now been thought for
some years that the opinion of the invention of
the arch by the Romans has been too hastily
adopted. The usual period assigned to the arch
is about B. C. 600. We thought we discovered a
contradiction of this idea in Egypt, but the present
case is far more satisfactory. The whole of
the long passage of 50 feet, the chamber 15 feet
square, the two doors, and the passage under the
pools in each case, are true 'Roman' arches, with
a perfect keystone. Now, as it has never been
seriously doubted that Solomon built the pools
ascribed to him, and to which he probably refers
in Ecclesiastes ii. 6, the arch must of course
have been well known about or before the time
of the building of the first temple, B. C. 1012.
The 'sealed fountain,' which is near, has the
same arch in several places; but this might have
been Roman. But here the arched ways pass
probably the whole distance under the pools,
and are therefore at least coeval with them, or
were rather built before them, in order to convey
the water down the valley. What I saw
convinced me that the perfect keystone Roman
arch was in familiar use in the time of Solomon,
or 1,000 years before the Christian era."</p>

</div>


<p>T<span class="smcapa">HROUGHOUT</span> all the Union, there is no region
more full of an abounding life and activity than
western New York. Its people, inheriting from
their New England ancestors their unresting
energy in all practical affairs, and their habits
of keen and close investigation in everything
connected with their social or moral development,
seem, in a great measure, to have laid
aside the conservatism, the wary circumspection
that the descendant of the Puritans has still retained.
Enjoying the gifts of nature bestowed
with a more bounteous hand and a freer mode
of life, they have thrown off many of the shackles
or restraints with which the worldly prudence
of the New Englander hampers him in action,
however loose he may suffer the reins to lie on
his mind or fancy; but, whatever result his reason
or benevolence works out, a genuine New
Yorker would exemplify in his conduct, with a
high disdain for all who suffered the baser motives
of prudence or fear of censure to withhold
them from the same course.</p>

<p>The people of that section of the country are
so accustomed to see the singular theories, that
are only talked about in other places, carried
out into action by their zealous promulgators or
defenders, that the eccentricities that, in most
country villages, would throw all the people
into a high state of astonishment, and supply
them with a topic of conversation for months,
there only causes a gentle ripple over the surface
of society; or, to give a truer illustration,
the waves there are always rolling so fast and
high, that one wave more or less makes but little
impression.</p>

<p>But when, from this unquiet ocean, a Bloomer
was left stranded on the still shores of our quiet
little town of Westbridge, our dismay and agitation
can be but faintly described. Socially speaking,
propriety is our divinity; Mrs. Grundy, our
avenging deity. We frown on short sleeves;
but when those short skirts were seen waving
in our streets, when they even floated up the
broad aisle on the Sabbath, it would be hard to
say whether indignation or horror were the predominant
feeling.</p>

<p>But, to begin at the beginning, as is in all
cases most proper and satisfactory, Jane Atwood
announced at our Sewing Society, and Mrs. Atwood
mentioned, in the course of a round of
calls, that they were expecting Miss Janet McLeod,
a niece of the late Mr. Atwood, to pass
the winter with them. We all knew Mr. McLeod
by reputation, for Mrs. Atwood was very
proud of her relationship to him, and references
to her brother-in-law were frequently and complacently
made. We had seen him, too, when
now and then he had passed a day with the Atwoods&mdash;he
never found time to stay in Westbridge
more than a day&mdash;and were astonished to
find that the rich Mr. McLeod, who had been
for some time a sort of a myth among us, a
Westbridge Mrs. Harris, was a plain, homespun-looking
man, with a comely sun-browned face,
white hair, and the kindest and most trusting
brown eyes in the world. His manners were
hearty and genial, but their simplicity prevented
him from making a great impression on us; we
like more courtliness and a little more formality.
His benevolence and uprightness, together with
his immense wealth, procured for him among us
that degree of consideration which such things
always do procure among the numerous class
who take the world as they find it, and we dismissed
him with the remark that, though plain
and unpolished in his manners, he possessed
sterling goodness and sound sense.</p>

<p>This last quality might not have been allowed
him, if Mrs. Atwood had not been careful in
concealing, as far as possible, the peculiar revelations
he made in each visit of his reigning enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"That Mr. McLeod is a very strange man,"
said Mrs. Atwood's nurse to a former employer
of hers. "Do you know, ma'am, he spent all
yesterday pulverizing Miss Jane! Miss Jane
went sound asleep, and I thought in my heart
she would never wake up no more."</p>

<p>It was found out afterwards that Jane Atwood
had been undergoing some experiments in mesmerism,
which, although Mr. McLeod declared
them triumphantly successful, Mrs. Atwood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
rather inclined to conceal than converse about.
This was on Mr. McLeod's first visit. On his
second, he found Mrs. Atwood suffering from
an attack of rheumatism. He pulled out of a
capacious pocket-book two galvanic rings, which
he insisted on her wearing; and, for fear that
they might not effect so speedy a cure as he
wished, he hastened to the city and returned
with a galvanic battery, by means of which he
gave his sister-in-law such severe shocks that
she assured us often "that her nervous system
was entirely shattered by them." But, as I have
known many ladies live and get a fair proportion
of enjoyment out of this life with their nervous
systems in the same dilapidated state, I have
come to consider it a very harmless complaint.</p>

<p>At another time, Mr. McLeod had wonderful
stories to tell of spiritual manifestations, and on
his last visit he had been overflowing with indignation
against society on the score of woman's
rights and wrongs.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding these peculiarities, Mrs.
Atwood loved and esteemed Mr. McLeod with
a sincerity that redeemed her otherwise worldly
and timid character. Her husband had been
left dependent on his half brother, and owed to
him his education and his establishment in the
world; and, when a fortune was left by some
relation of their mother to be equally divided
between them, Mr. McLeod refused to take any
portion of it, saying that he had more than
enough. These, with many other instances of
his generosity and affection which Mrs. Atwood
had received since her widowhood, made
her forget his eccentricities, and listen with forbearance
to his impetuous outbursts of zeal or
indignation.</p>

<p>There was another person in Westbridge who
shared Mrs. Atwood's affectionate gratitude to
Mr. McLeod, and from similar causes; and this
was Professor Mainwaring. He was the professor
of ancient languages in the college at Westbridge,
and the society of the place, as well as
the members of the college, thought it a high
honor to be able to number such a man as one
of themselves. He combined, in a manner that
is seldom seen, the high-bred gentleman with
the accomplished scholar and the strict and severe
theologian, for he was a clergyman as well
as a professor; and when to this it is added that
he was still unmarried, it will hardly be wondered
at if he were an object of general attention,
carefully restrained though within its proper
limits.</p>

<p>He also had been indebted in early life to Mr.
McLeod; for, although brought up in the habits,
and with the expectation of being a rich
man, he found himself in the second year of his
college life left, by the sudden death of his
father, Judge Mainwaring, entirely destitute.
With no friends who were able or willing to
assist him, George Mainwaring was about to
give up reluctantly all hopes of completing the
studies in which he had so far been eminently
successful, and had already begun to look about
for some means of obtaining a present support,
when Mr. McLeod heard of his position, and,
with the prompt and delicate generosity peculiar
to him, came forward with offers of assistance.
He claimed a right, as an old friend of George
Mainwaring's father, to interest himself in the
young student's welfare; and, with some hesitation,
such as every independent mind naturally
feels, Mr. Mainwaring accepted the offered
aid.</p>

<p>The pecuniary obligation had long since been
repaid, but the feeling of gratitude to the one
who had enabled him to pursue the career best
fitted to the bent of his mind remained in full
force; and, from the influence of this feeling,
he had been induced to make an offer to Mr.
McLeod, which was the immediate occasion of
Miss McLeod's visit to Westbridge.</p>

<p>Mr. McLeod had been for some years devoting
himself spasmodically to the study of Revelations.
He fancied that he had discovered the
clue to the meaning of many of the most mysterious
parts of this book; but, unfortunately,
there were many little discrepancies between his
ideas and those apparently conveyed by the
words of this part of Holy Writ. These he attributed
to a faulty translation, and had himself
begun one that was to be free from such blemishes;
but, finding that his knowledge of the
language was insufficient, or that his patience
was soon exhausted, he determined that his
daughter Janet should qualify herself to perform
this office for him.</p>

<p>She would have undertaken to learn Chinese,
if her father had expressed a wish to that effect,
and therefore made no opposition to studying
Greek, nor to passing the winter in Westbridge
with her aunt, that she might avail herself of
the proposal Mr. Mainwaring had made to her
father, that he should be her instructor. Miss
McLeod had never been in Westbridge, and Mr.
Mainwaring had never happened to meet her.
He knew that she was a young lady of eighteen,
and that, since her mother's death, some three
years before, she had devoted herself entirely to
making her father's home as comfortable and
happy as possible. Her filial affection had prepossessed
him very much in her favor, and he
looked forward to aiding her in her studies with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
an unusual degree of pleasure. Jane Atwood,
too, was delighted at the prospect of renewing
an acquaintance that had languished since her
childhood.</p>

<p>Mr. McLeod was prevented, by some of his
numerous engagements, from accompanying his
daughter to Westbridge, as he had intended; and,
placing her under the care of an acquaintance
who was on his way to the city of New York, he
telegraphed to Professor Mainwaring a request
that he would meet Miss McLeod at the Westbridge
depot.</p>

<p>The cars arrived about twilight, and, punctually
at the appointed time, Mr. Mainwaring
and Miss Atwood stood on the platform waiting
for the stopping of the train. The young lady
looked in vain among the group that sprang
hurriedly out of the cars to find one that she
could recognize as her cousin. Mr. Mainwaring
scrutinized the crowd with a like purpose,
but as fruitlessly. Their attention was arrested
at the same moment by the same object&mdash;the
singular attire of a person leaning on the arm of
an old gentleman, who was looking around him
evidently greatly hurried and perplexed. Mr.
Mainwaring gave but one glance, and then
looked away, apparently considering the individual
hardly a proper subject of curiosity; but
Jane Atwood, less scrupulous, stood gazing so
absorbed in what she saw that she entirely forgot
her cousin.</p>

<p>The person who thus attracted her notice was
a small and youthful woman, dressed in a sort
of sack or paletot of black cloth, belted around
her waist and falling a little below the knee,
and loose trowsers of the same material gathered
into a band around the ankle, leaving
exposed a small foot encased in thick-soled, but
neatly-fitting gaiter boots. A linen collar tied
around the throat with a broad black ribbon, and
a straw bonnet and veil, completed the attire.</p>

<p>"That must be a Bloomer, Mr. Mainwaring,"
said Jane Atwood; "do just look at her. I am
very glad she happened to come in this train. I
have always wanted to see one."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Mr. Mainwaring, in a tone
that expressed more surprise than approval.
"Do you see your cousin anywhere, Miss Atwood?"
asked he, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p>She replied in the negative.</p>

<p>"Allow me to leave you a moment, and I
will make some inquiries." And, after attending
Miss Atwood to the ladies' saloon, the professor
hurried off to inquire after his charge.</p>

<p>Hardly had he gone before the old gentleman
and the Bloomer entered.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, ma'am," said the gentleman,
addressing Miss Atwood; "but I am afraid to
wait here any longer, for fear the cars will leave
me, and I promised Mr. McLeod I would see
his daughter safely to her friends. Do you know
whether Professor Mainwaring is here to meet
her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is," said Miss Atwood, with a sudden
misgiving. "Is&mdash;is&mdash;is this&mdash;person&mdash;lady&mdash;Miss
McLeod?" Miss Atwood could hardly
finish the question.</p>

<p>The Bloomer threw back her veil, and said,
somewhat timidly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is this Miss Atwood&mdash;Cousin Jane?"</p>

<p>Miss Atwood bowed, and the old gentleman,
saying, "I am glad you have found your friends,"
hurried off.</p>

<p>There were a few moments of embarrassed
silence, when Professor Mainwaring reappeared.</p>

<p>"Miss McLeod cannot be in this train," said
he. "Shall we wait here for the next? It will
be down in an hour."</p>

<p>"This is Miss McLeod, Professor Mainwaring,"
said Miss Atwood, hardly conscious of the
ungracious manner in which she effected the
introduction.</p>

<p>Mr. Mainwaring bowed with his usual ceremonious
politeness; but he said not a word, and
his lips closed with a firmer compression than
usual. He was too indignant and astonished to
speak. He wondered if his old benefactor had
quite lost his senses that he should permit his
young daughter to go about dressed in that outrageous
costume. And he did not see with what
propriety he, the guide and controller of more
than a hundred young men, who required all
the power of his example and authority to keep
them in proper order, could be asked to teach,
or in any way have his name connected with
that of a Bloomer. He was more than half inclined
to walk away; but, restraining himself,
he observed that the carriage was waiting, and
had instinctively half turned to Miss McLeod to
offer her his arm, but, catching another glimpse
of the costume, in itself a sort of a declaration
of independence, and remembering having seen
a number of students lingering around the depot,
he bowed hastily and led the way to the
carriage.</p>

<p>Miss McLeod's manner had all the time been
very composed and quiet. She could not help
observing that her greeting was not a very warm
one; but this was her first absence from home,
and her thoughts were so full of those she had
left behind that she was not fully conscious of
all that was passing around her. She seated
herself in the carriage, and, after answering the
few formal questions addressed to her by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
companions, she sank with them into a silence
that remained unbroken until they reached Mrs.
Atwood's door.</p>

<p>Declining Miss Atwood's invitation to walk
in, Professor Mainwaring bade them good-evening,
murmuring something hastily about seeing
Miss McLeod again soon, and walked off, glad
to be released even for a moment from his distasteful
duty of attendance.</p>

<p>Miss Atwood ushered her companion into the
drawing-room, and then went to seek her mother.
She found her in the kitchen giving directions
to a new cook about the preparations
for tea. She beckoned her into the dining-room.</p>

<p>"She's come, mother," said Jane, with wide-open
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, I know it. Go and stay with
her; I will come in in a minute."</p>

<p>"She's a Bloomer!" continued Jane, unheeding
the maternal bidding.</p>

<p>"You don't say so, Jane! What! little Janet
a Bloomer! Oh, Jane!" And Mrs. Atwood
sank down on the nearest seat. This was worse
than the galvanic battery. Her nervous system
gave way entirely, and she burst into a flood of
tears. "I cannot go in to see her," said Mrs.
Atwood. "I don't think I can have her here in
my house with my children."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mother, we must," said Jane; "remember
how kind uncle McLeod has always
been to us. Don't be so distressed about it.
Perhaps we can induce her to change her style
of dress."</p>

<p>While Jane was endeavoring to soothe her
mother, Janet McLeod had been trying to overcome
the shyness of two little children whom
she had found in the drawing-room. She was
telling them about a pony and a dog she had at
home, when the boy raised his head and asked,
with the straightforwardness of a child&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I know," said the little girl, shaking her
head with a very wise look.</p>

<p>"Do you? Who am I?" asked Janet, amused
by her earnest manner.</p>

<p>"I don't like to tell oo; but I'll tell Tarley,
if he'll bend down his head."</p>

<p>Charley bent his head, and the child said, in
a loud whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's the little ooman that went to market
to sell her eggs; don't oo see?"</p>

<p>"Are you?" asked Charley.</p>

<p>"No; I am your cousin Janet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I always thought Janet was a girl's
name. I am glad you are a boy. I like boys a
great deal the best."</p>

<p>Here Charley was interrupted by his mother's
entrance. Mrs. Atwood had composed herself,
and had come to the conclusion that she might
as well make the best of it. She greeted Janet
in a manner rather constrained and embarrassed,
and yet not cold enough to be wounding; and
this she thought was doing wonders.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday, and Mrs. Atwood
saw, with dismay, Janet preparing to go to church
in the same attire.</p>

<p>"Have you no long dresses that you could
wear to-day, my dear?" she asked. "We are so
unaccustomed here to see anything of that kind,
that I am afraid it will attract more attention
than you would like."</p>

<p>"No," replied Janet, with a composure that
was not a little irritating to Mrs. Atwood, "I
did not bring any with me. I promised father
that I would wear this dress at least a year."</p>

<p>Jane Atwood had a convenient headache,
which prevented her from accompanying the
rest of the family to church, and Mrs. Atwood
had to bear the whole brunt of the popular
amazement and curiosity, as, followed by a
Bloomer, she made her entrance among the assembled
congregation. The walk up the aisle
was accomplished with a flurried haste, very
unlike the usual grave decorum on which Mrs.
Atwood piqued herself, and, slipping into her
pew, she sat for some minutes without venturing
to raise her eyes.</p>

<p>Miss McLeod did not share her aunt's perturbation.
She appeared, in fact, hardly conscious
of being an object of general remark, but addressed
herself to the duties of the sanctuary
with a countenance as calm and tranquil as a
summer's day. A very sweet and rural face she
had, as unlike her startling style of dress as
anything could well be. Having always lived
in the country, surrounded by an unsophisticated
kind of people who had known her from her
infancy, and loved her for her father's sake as
well as her own, and who, reverencing Mr.
McLeod for his noble and kindly traits of character,
looked upon his many crotchets as the
outbursts of a generous, if an undisciplined nature,
Janet had never learned to fear the criticism
or the ridicule of the unsympathetic world.</p>

<p>Like most persons brought up in the sheltered
seclusion of the country, far away from the
bustle and turmoil of the city, where every faculty
is kept in activity by the constant demand
upon its attention, her mind was slow in its
operations, and her perceptions were not very
quick. At ease in herself, because convinced
by her father's advice and persuasions that she
was in the path of duty, she hardly observed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
astonishment and remark of which she was the
object. What Bulwer Lytton calls "the broad
glare of the American eye" fell upon her as ineffectually
as sunshine on a rock.</p>

<p>With a disposition naturally dependent, and
inclined to believe rather than to doubt and
examine for herself, she had grown up with such
a deep reverence for her father, and with such
an entire belief in him, that the idea of questioning
the propriety or soundness of his opinions
never entered her mind. It was hard labor for
one so practical and unimaginative as Janet to
follow up the vagaries of a man like Mr. McLeod,
and it was one of the strongest proofs of
her great affection for him, that she had laid
aside her own correct judgment and good sense
to do so.</p>

<p>That same evening Mrs. Atwood had a long
conversation with Miss McLeod about her dress.
It was a disagreeable task to one of Mrs. Atwood's
timid disposition to find fault with any
person; but she thought it a duty she owed to
her motherless niece, at least, to expostulate with
her about so great a singularity.</p>

<p>"Will you tell me, my dear," she said, "how
you came to adopt that costume?"</p>

<p>"It was my father's wish," Janet replied.
"He was convinced that it was a much more
sensible and useful mode of dress than the usual
fashion of long trailing skirts, and he was very
anxious that it should be generally adopted; but
he said it never would be unless it were worn
habitually by ladies occupying a certain station
in society. He thought that, as we had so many
advantages, we ought to be willing to make some
sacrifices for the general good. I did not much
like the idea at first, but I found that father was
right when he said that I should soon become
accustomed to the singularity of the thing; and
indeed it is hardly considered singular in Danvers
now. Several of the ladies there have
adopted the same style of dress. We find it a
great deal more convenient."</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwood could not assent; she could not
see a single redeeming quality in the odious costume.</p>

<p>"Would you object, Janet, to laying it aside
while you remain in Westbridge? I am sure
that you will effect no good by wearing it, and I
am afraid you will be rendered painfully conspicuous
by it. Young ladies should never do
anything to make themselves an object of remark."</p>

<p>This aphorism, which was the guiding principle
of every lady trained in Westbridge, was
a new idea to Janet. She pondered upon it for
a while, and then replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems to me, at least so my father always
tells me, that the only thing necessary to be
considered is, whether we are doing right or not;
and if this dress is to do as much good as father
thinks it will, it must be my duty to wear it. I
promised father I would wear it for a year at
least."</p>

<p>"If your father will consent, will you not be
willing to dress like the rest of us while you remain
here? It would be a great favor to me if
you would."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear aunt, I will. But it seems
strange to me that you should be so annoyed by
what father is so much delighted with."</p>

<p>Mrs. Atwood wrote what she considered quite
a strong appeal to Mr. McLeod, entreating him
to allow his daughter to resume her former attire.
But in reply, Mr. McLeod wrote that
Janet was now occupying the position in which
he had always wished a child of his to be placed.
She was in the front rank of reformers; giving
an example to the people in Westbridge, whom
he had always considered shamefully behind the
age, which he hoped would awaken in them
some desire for progress and improvement. He
was proud of her and of her position. He would
not for the world have her falter now, when, for
the first time, she had had any conflict to endure.</p>

<p>Janet read the letter, and, with a blush for
her weakness in yielding to her aunt's suggestions,
she resolved to allow no pusillanimous
fear of censure to degrade her father's daughter
from the high station in which he had placed
her. Mrs. Atwood was indignant at Mr. McLeod's
answer.</p>

<p>"I never read anything with so little common
sense or common feeling in it. I am sure he
would not be willing to subject himself to all
the annoyances to which he is exposing his poor
young daughter, persuading her that she is in
the path of duty, and that she ought to make a
sacrifice of herself. I have no patience with
him," and Mrs. Atwood, in her vexation, came
very near giving Charley a superfluous whipping.</p>

<p>Meantime, the people in Westbridge were debating
as to the expediency of calling on the
new arrival. They were in great perplexity
about it. As Mrs. Atwood's niece, Miss McLeod
ought certainly to be visited; but as a Bloomer
she ought to be frowned upon and discountenanced.
The general opinion was decidedly
against showing her any attention. One lady
did call, but repented it afterwards, and atoned
for her imprudent sociability by declining to recognize
Miss McLeod when she met her in the
street. There were very few invitations sent to
Mrs. Atwood's during the winter, and those that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
came were very pointedly addressed to Mrs. and
Miss Atwood. These they at first declined,
with much inward reluctance on Jane's part;
but Janet perceiving this, and divining that politeness
to her was the cause of the refusals,
insisted on being no restraint on her cousin's
pleasure. She was willing to endure mortifications
herself for what she considered her duty,
but it would be a needless addition to her trials,
she said, if those who did not approve of her
course had to suffer for it.</p>

<p>It seems a pity that there should be such a
superfluity of the martyr spirit in womankind,
or that there were not something of more vital
importance to wreak it upon than the rights and
wrongs that are just now causing such an effervescence
among them.</p>

<p>Meantime, Mr. Mainwaring had decided that,
come in what shape she might, Mr. McLeod's
daughter ought to receive from him all the attention
that gratitude for her father's services
might demand. Every morning he devoted an
hour to giving her a lesson in Greek, and though
for some time he continued to look upon her
with suspicion and distrust as a <em>femme forte</em>,
yet his urbane and polished manners prevented
Janet from perceiving anything that might
wound or offend her. She felt that the gentle
cordiality with which she was at first inclined
to receive him, as one whom her father loved
and esteemed, met with no response, but she
attributed it to his natural reserve. The first
thing that lessened the cold disapproval with
which Mr. Mainwaring regarded Janet was the
discovery that study was to her a painful labor,
and that she was not very fond of reading.
There is a popular fallacy that a high cultivation
of the intellect implies a corresponding deficiency
in the affections, and profoundly sensible
as Mr. Mainwaring was, he was, like most
men, a firm believer in this erroneous opinion;
and therefore he welcomed all Janet's mistakes
as pledges that, though her judgment might be
wrong, her heart was right.</p>

<p>And there was a yielding docility about her
that was exceedingly pleasing to one accustomed,
as Mr. Mainwaring was, to have his opinion
regarded as law by most of those with whom he
was thrown. It was not a mere inert softness
either, but the pliability of a substance so finely
tempered and wrought that it could be moulded
by a master hand into any form without losing
its native and inherent firmness and goodness.
He began at last to understand her, and to perceive
that she had one of those delicate and
conscientious natures that, when once convinced
of a duty, seize upon it with a grasp of iron, and
would suffer to the death for it. With his admiration
for Janet, his interest in her increased,
and he became truly distressed to see her throwing
away, as it seemed, her usefulness and her
happiness in endeavoring to uphold a fantastic
fashion.</p>

<p>The life of seclusion and study to which the
resolute neglect of the people of Westbridge had
condemned Janet was so unlike anything to
which she had been accustomed, that, strong in
constitution as she was, with all the vigor that
a free country life gives, her health began at last
to fail. The spring breezes sought in vain for
the loses that the autumn winds had left upon
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that you are looking rather
pale, Miss McLeod," said Mr. Mainwaring, one
day.</p>

<p>It was the first time that he had ever spoken
to her on any subject unconnected with the
lessons, and Miss McLeod colored slightly as
she answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am quite well, I believe."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you do not exercise enough. I
see Miss Atwood walking every pleasant afternoon.
If you would join her sometimes, you
might find a benefit from it."</p>

<p>Again Janet blushed as she answered, with a
frank smile&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cousin Jane is very kind; but I believe she
would do anything for me sooner than walk
with me. At any rate, I would not like to place
her in a position that would be so painful to
her. And I do not like to walk by myself here."</p>

<p>Miss McLeod did not acknowledge, what Mr.
Mainwaring had perceived, that a growing shyness
had been coming over her since her residence
in Westbridge, leading her to keep out of
sight as much as possible. A very faint-hearted
reformer was poor little Janet, and I am afraid
that her co-workers would have disdained to
acknowledge her.</p>

<p>"You have not made many acquaintances in
Westbridge, I think, Miss McLeod?"</p>

<p>"No, none besides aunt Atwood's family and
yourself."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, for there are many very
agreeable and intelligent people here. Few
country villages can boast of as good society.
I do not see you often at church lately, I
think."</p>

<p>"No, I do not go so regularly as I ought,"
said Janet, sadly.</p>

<p>"How would you like a class in the Sunday
School? It might be an object of interest, and
visiting your scholars would be a motive to take
you out occasionally. The clergyman mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
lately that they were very much in want of
teachers."</p>

<p>The tears came in Janet's eyes. It seemed to
her that Mr. Mainwaring must be trying to
wound her, or that he was one of the most unobservant
of men, that, with so little tact, he
was reminding her of all the social duties and
kindnesses from which she was debarred.</p>

<p>"I offered my services the other day, but
they were declined," said she.</p>

<p>"On account of your mode of dress, I presume,"
said he.</p>

<p>Janet bowed.</p>

<p>"If my obligations to your father had not
been so great that they can never be repaid, I
might feel that I was taking too great a liberty,
if I should venture to express any disapproval
of anything that you might think proper to do.
But I will run the risk of displeasing you, and
ask you whether you think it worth while, even
supposing one mode of dress to possess far more
real superiority over the prevailing fashion than
the one does which you have adopted, to sacrifice
not only your social enjoyments, but your
usefulness, for the purpose of making an ineffectual
attempt to change a fashion under which
so many people have lived in health and comfort,
that it will be difficult to persuade them
that it is injurious?"</p>

<p>"At home, my style of dress was not thought
so wrong," said Janet. "There are not many
places, I think, where I should not have met with
more liberality and charity than in Westbridge."</p>

<p>"All over the world, Miss Janet"&mdash;and, for
the first time, the professor called Miss McLeod
by her Christian name&mdash;"dress is considered as
an exponent of character. When a person is
thrown among strangers, they are judged almost
as much by that as by their countenance. And
when they adopt a style of dress, the mark of a
particular clique, they are considered as indorsing
all the opinions belonging to it. Now, the
ideas of the Bloomerites are many of them so
flighty, and have so little reason or common
sense in them, that I am sure you are not acquainted
with them, or you would not so openly
rank yourself with their party."</p>

<p>Poor Janet had heard her father talk for hours
about the absurdity of the usual mode of dress,
and the advantages of the Bloomer costume;
but now, in her time of need, she could not recall
a single one of his arguments. Not that
she was entirely overpowered by the professor's
reasons, but, partly from her own observation
of his character, and partly from general report,
she had imbibed so high an opinion of Mr.
Mainwaring's judgment and understanding, that
she felt unequal to opposing him. There was a
soundness in his opinions, with a firmness and
strength in his whole nature, to which she yielded
an unconscious deference.</p>

<p>This was by no means the only conversation
Mr. Mainwaring and Janet had on the subject
of her unfortunate dress. Slowly and gradually
the young girl began to realize that she might
have been wasting the whole energies of her
earnest nature in a Quixotic contest with what
was in itself harmless. At any rate, she became
convinced that "<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">le jeu ne vaut pas le chandelle</em>,"
and yet she was unwilling to take any decided
step without consulting her father. She was
afraid that he would be greatly disappointed in
her, when he found her so weak that she shrank
from the notice and comments her attire attracted.</p>

<p>Seeing that Miss McLeod was disinclined to
make the effort, Mr. Mainwaring wrote himself
to Mr. McLeod, who, although he was unable
to appreciate the "delicate distresses" which
Mrs. Atwood had hinted at, as the consequence
of his daughter's singularity, was alarmed and
distressed at the idea of her illness. He came
immediately to Westbridge, and took Janet home
to recruit. But, before he went, Mr. Mainwaring
had a long conversation with him, and,
either by his cogent arguments, or because some
new crotchet had displaced the old one, he obtained
his permission that Janet should resume
the flowing robes against which he had once declared
such unsparing antipathy.</p>

<p>During the next summer, Janet stopped for a
few weeks at Mrs. Atwood's, on her way to
Saratoga, and we took advantage of the opportunity
to call upon her, acting towards her as
though this were her first visit to Westbridge,
and considering it an act of delicate politeness
to ignore the fact that the young lady, whom
we saw so simply and tastefully attired, had any
connection with the Bloomer who had awakened
our horror not long before.</p>

<p>The latest piece of news in Westbridge is the
established fact that Mr. Mainwaring is engaged
to Miss McLeod. He who has withstood all the
charms of the well brought up ladies of our
town has been captivated by a Bloomer, and
that, too, after having declared, openly and repeatedly,
his disapproval and utter distaste for
all women who had in any way made themselves
conspicuous. But there seems to be naturally
a perversity in all matters of this kind.
Love evidently delights in bending the inclinations
in that very direction against which the
professions have been the loudest and most decided.</p>

<h2>CELESTIAL PHENOMENA.&mdash;MAY.</h2>

<p class="p5">BY D. W. BELISLE.</p>


<p>COMA BERENICES.&mdash;This is a beautiful
cluster of small stars, situated about five degrees
east of the equinoctial colure, and midway between
Cor-Caroli on the north-east, and Denebola
on the south-west. The stars that compose
this group are small, but very bright, and are in
close proximity to each other; therefore the
cluster is readily distinguished from all others.
There is a number of small nebulæ in this assemblage,
which give it a faintly luminous appearance,
somewhat resembling the milky-way.
The whole number of stars in this cluster is
forty-three. It comes to the meridian on the
13th of May.</p>

<p>This constellation is of Egyptian origin. Berenice
was married to Evergetes, King of Egypt,
and, on his going out to battle against the Assyrians,
she vowed to dedicate her hair, which
was of extraordinary beauty, to the goddess of
beauty, if her lord returned in safety. Evergetes
returned victorious, and, agreeably to her
oath, her locks were shorn and deposited in the
temple of Venus, whence they shortly disappeared,
and the king and queen were assured by
Conon, the astronomer, that they had been taken
from the altar by Jupiter and placed among the
stars; and, to convince them of the truth of his
assertion, pointed out this cluster, and</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"There Berenice's locks first rose so bright,</div>
  <div class="i0">The heavens bespangling with dishevelled light."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This group being among the unformed stars until
that time, and not known as a constellation,
the king became satisfied with the declaration
of Conon, who, pointing to the group, said,
"There, behold the locks of our queen." Berenice
was not only reconciled to this petty larceny
of Jupiter, but was proud of the partiality
of the god. Callimachus, who flourished before
the Christian era, thus adverts to it&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Immortal Conon, blest with skill divine,</div>

  <div class="i0">Refulgent beams from Berenice's head;</div>
  <div class="i0">The locks she fondly vowed, with lifted arms,</div>
  <div class="i0">Imploring all the powers to save from harm</div>
  <div class="i0">Her dearer lord, when from his bride he flew,</div>
  <div class="i0">To wreak stern vengeance on the Assyrian crew."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>CORVUS.&mdash;This small constellation is situated
east of the Cup, and may be readily distinguished
by four bright stars of the third magnitude,
which form a trapezium; the two upper
ones being three and a half degrees apart, and
the two lower ones six degrees apart. Algorab,
the most eastern star of these four, forms the
east wing of the Crow, and comes to the meridian
on the 13th of May. Beta, in the foot of
the Crow, is seven degrees south of Algorab,
and is the brighter of the two lower stars; and
on the left, six degrees west of Beta, is Epsilon,
which marks the neck, while two degrees below
it is Al Chiba, a star of the fourth magnitude,
which marks the head.</p>

<p>This constellation is of Greek origin, and it
is gravely asserted by their ancient historians
that this bird was originally of the purest white,
but was changed, for tale-bearing, to its present
color.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"The raven once in snowy plumes was drest,</div>
  <div class="i0">White as the whitest dove's unsullied breast,</div>

  <div class="i0">Soft as the swan, a fair and lovely fowl;</div>
  <div class="i0">His tongue, his prating tongue, had changed him quite</div>
  <div class="i0">To sooty blackness from the purest white."</div>
 </div>
</div>

<p>Apollo, becoming jealous of Coronis, sent a crow
to watch her movements. The bird discovered
her partiality for Ischys, and immediately acquainted
the god with it, which so fired his indignation:

<p>VIRGO.&mdash;This constellation lies directly south
of Coma Berenice, and east of Leo. It occupies
considerable space in the heavens, and contains
one hundred and ten stars. It comes to the
meridian the 23d of this month. Spica Virginis,
which marks the left hand of the Virgin, is a
star of the first magnitude, and is of great brilliancy,
and, with Denebola in Leo, and Arcturus
in Boötes, forms a large equilateral triangle,
which, joined with Cor-Caroli, a star of the
same brilliancy, at an equal distance north,
forms the <em>Diamond of Virgo</em>. The stars in this
diamond are of equal brilliancy, rendering it one
of the most clearly defined and most beautiful
figures in this part of the heavens.</p>

<p>This constellation is probably of Egyptian
origin. A zodiac discovered among the ruins
of Estne, in Egypt, commences with Virgo, and,
according to the regular progression of the equinoxes,
this zodiac must be two thousand years
older than that at Dendera. This relic of the
earliest ages of the human species is conjectured
to have been preserved during the deluge by
Noah, to perpetuate the actual appearance of the
heavens immediately subsequent to the creation.</p>

<p>The Athenians also claim the origin of this
constellation, maintaining that Erigone was
changed into Virgo. Erigone was the daughter
of Icarius, an Athenian, who was slain by some
peasants whom he had intoxicated with wine;
and it caused such a feeling of despair in Erigone,
that she repaired to the wood and hung
herself on the bough of a tree.</p>

<p>ASTERION ET CHARA.&mdash;This is a modern
constellation, and embraces two in one. It lies
north of Coma Berenice, and west of Bootes, and
comes to the meridian the 20th of May. Cor-Caroli
is the brightest star in this group, and
marks Chara, the southern hound. Asterion is
north of this, and is marked by a small star
about three degrees above Cor-Caroli. These
two hounds are represented as chasing the Great
Bear around the Pole, being held in a leash by
Bootes, who is constantly urging them on in
their endless track. The remaining stars in this
group are too small and scattered to excite interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>URSA MAJOR.&mdash;This constellation is situated
between Ursa Minor on the north, and Leo
Minor on the south, and is one of the most conspicuous
in the northern hemisphere. It has
been an object of observation in all ages of the
world. The shepherds of Chaldea, Magi of
Persia, priests of Belus, Phœnician navigators,
Arabs of Asia, and American aborigines seem
to have been equally struck with its peculiar
outlines, and each gave to the group a name
which signified, in their respective languages,
the same thing&mdash;<em>Great Bear</em>. It is somewhat
remarkable that nations which had no knowledge
or communication with each other should
have given the same name to this constellation.
The name is perfectly arbitrary, there being no
resemblance in it whatever to a bear or any
other animal.</p>

<p>This cluster is remarkable for seven of its
brightest stars forming a dipper, four stars forming
the bowl, and three, curving slightly, shaping
the handle. These seven stars are of uncommon
brilliancy, and need no description to
point out their locality. The whole number of
stars in this group is eighty-seven, and it comes
to the meridian the 10th of May.</p>

<h2>MANUFACTURE OF PINS.</h2>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> often hear the expression used, when
talking of anything comparatively useless, that
"it's not worth a pin;" and from this we might
be led to suppose, did we not know it to be
otherwise, that a pin was a very worthless thing,
instead of being what it is&mdash;one of the most useful
that is manufactured in this or in any other
country. As the use of pins is principally confined
to the female portion of our community,
perhaps the following short account of their
manufacture, for which we are indebted to
Knight's "Cyclopædia of Industry," a very useful
book, may not be uninteresting to our readers:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pins are made of brass wire. The first
process which it undergoes, by which any dirt
or crust that may be attached to the surface is
got rid of, is by soaking it in a diluted solution
of sulphuric acid and water, and then beating
it on stones. It is then straightened; after
which, it is cut into pieces, each about long
enough for six pins. These latter pieces are
then pointed at each end in the following manner:
The person so employed sits in front of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
small machine, which has two steel wheels or
mills turning rapidly, of which the rims are cut
somewhat after the manner of a file: one coarse
for the rough formation of the points, and the
other fine for finishing them. Several of these
pieces are taken in the hand, and, by a dexterous
movement of the thumb and forefinger, are kept
continually presenting a different face to the mill
against which they are pressed. The points are
then finished off by being applied in the same
manner to the fine mill. After both ends of the
pieces have been pointed, one pin's length is cut
off from each end, when they are re-pointed, and
so on until each length is converted into six
pointed pieces. The stems of the pins are then
complete. The next step is to form the head,
which is effected by a piece of wire called the
mould, the same size as that used for the stems,
being attached to a small axis or lathe. At the
end of the wire nearest the axis is a hole, in
which is placed the end of a smaller wire, which
is to form the heading. While the mould-wire
is turned round by one hand, the head-wire is
guided by the other, until it is wound in a spiral
coil along the entire length of the former. It is
then cut off close to the hole where it was
commenced, and the coil taken off the mould.
When a quantity of these coils are prepared, a
workman takes a dozen or more of them at a
time in his left hand, while, with a pair of shears
in his right, he cuts them up into pieces of two
coils each. The heads, when cut off, are annealed
by being made hot and then thrown into water.
When annealed, they are ready to be fixed on
the stems. In order to do this, the operator is
provided with a small stake, upon which is fixed
a steel die, containing a hollow the exact shape
of half the head. Above this die, and attached
to a lever, is the corresponding die for the other
half of the head, which, when at rest, remains
suspended about two inches above the lower one.
The workman takes one of these stems between
his fingers, and, dipping the pointed end of a
bowl containing a number of heads, catches
one upon it and slides it to the other end; he
then places it in the lower die, and, moving a
treadle, brings down the upper one four or five
times upon the head, which fastens it upon the
stem, and also gives it the required figure.
There is a small channel leading from the outside
to the centre of the dies, to allow room for
the stem. The pins are now finished as regards
shape, and it only remains to tin or whiten them.
A quantity of them are boiled in a pickle, either
a solution of sulphuric acid or tartar, to remove
any dirt or grease, and also to produce a slight
roughness upon their surfaces which facilitates
the adhesion of the tin. After being boiled for
half an hour, they are washed, and then placed
in a copper vessel with a quantity of grain tin
and a solution of tartar; in about two hours and
a half, they are taken out, and, after being separated
from the undissolved tin by sifting, are
again washed; they are then dried by being well
shaken in a bag with a quantity of bran, which
is afterwards separated by shaking them up and
down in open wooden trays, when the bran flies
off and leaves the pins perfectly dry and clean.
The pins are then papered for sale."</p>

<p>Pins are also made solely by machinery. There
is a manufactory for this sort (the Patent Solid
Headed Pins, near Stroud) where nearly 3,250,000
are made daily.</p>

<p>A pin, then, is not such an insignificant article,
after all. We see it has to go through a great
many processes and hands before it is finished.
If we take one, examine it closely, and mark how
nicely it is made, how neatly the head is fixed on
to the shank, how beautifully it is pointed, and
how bright it shines, we shall see a very good
specimen of what the ingenuity and labor of man
can do upon a piece of metal. It is really surprising
what a large number are made, and how
many persons are employed in their manufacture.
We read, some time ago, an amusing article
from "Bentley's Miscellany," wherein the
writer asks the question: "What becomes of the
pins?" and puts forth the rather curious assertion
that, if they continue to be lost and made
away with as they are now, some day or other
the whole globe will be found to be "one vast
shapeless mass of pins."</p>

<p>In conclusion, we would recommend our readers
always to bear in mind the excellent maxim
which Franklin attached to a pin, namely, "A
pin a day, a groat a year."</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO A BRIDE.</h2>


<p>I <span class="smcapa">BEG</span> to remind my daughter that the husband
has a thousand elements of disturbance in his
daily avocations to which his wife is an utter
stranger; and it will be her privilege, and her
title to the respect of all whose respect is worth
having, to make his own fireside the most attractive
place in the universe for the calm repose
of a weary body or excited mind. The
minor comforts, which are the most valuable,
because the most constantly in requisition, will
depend more upon her look, her manner, and
the evidence of her forethought, than upon all
the other occurrences of life.&mdash;<em>Parental Precepts.</em></p>

<h2><a name="TRUTH_STRANGER_THAN_FICTION" id="TRUTH_STRANGER_THAN_FICTION"></a>"TRUTH STRANGER THAN FICTION."</h2>


<p>M<span class="smcapa">R</span>. G<span class="smcapa">ODEY</span>: Miss Snipe left my house in
great haste on the second day of April, forgetting,
in her precipitation, several articles of her
wardrobe and her portfolio. While waiting an
opportunity to forward them to Wimpleton, a
natural impulse of curiosity induced me to
examine the contents of the portfolio, when, lo
and behold, a letter, directed to yourself, fell on
the floor. Being loosely folded and unsealed, I
ventured to open it, supposing it merely a business
communication. Imagine my surprise on
discovering the nature of its contents, for I had
been unable to penetrate the reasons of her hurried
departure; but do not, I pray you, accuse
me of having read it <em>through</em>.</p>

<p>Finding, as far as I proceeded, nothing very
heinous laid to myself, nor any insinuations
against my table, I judge proper to forward it
without delay, according to the address. However,
I can with difficulty forgive her for calling
my boy a "cub," and think, moreover, that
her dislike towards my Irish inmate is unreasonable.
As to Mr. Sparks&mdash;I do not blame her
so much&mdash;he has not yet paid me those gloves.
And as to the writer herself, I am really astonished&mdash;we
all thought her such a quiet and unobservant
little body&mdash;on becoming acquainted
with this spirited volley from her pen. Will
there not be both laughing and wry faces in my
household, if you publish it? And, though
April is gone (I am sorry the letter was not
sooner found), do give the world the benefit of
her experience, to oblige and amuse</p>

<p class="center">Yours, faithfully,<br />
H<span class="smcapa">ELEN</span> M<span class="smcapa">ASHUM</span>.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="center"><em>April</em> 1, 1854.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcapa">Y DEAR</span> M<span class="smcapa">R</span>. E<span class="smcapa">DITOR</span>: Such a tumult as
we have all day been in, by reason of that abominable
practice of "fooling," has been enough to
destroy the patience of a saint. I am nearly out
of my wits. Here have I come, at my niece's
invitation, to spend a fortnight with her, in a
boarding-house. "She was lonely," she said;
"Mr. Sparks was so much at the office; and it
would be such a favor if I could stay with her
a few days."</p>

<p>So I have come from my quiet country home,
fifteen miles off, to this noisy town that calls itself
a city, to visit Ann Sophia; and, between
you and me, I was an April fool from the beginning.
There are several other young married
women boarding in the same house, who, like
my flighty niece, have apparently nothing under
the sun to do but go shopping and pop in and
out of each other's rooms. Some of them are
in her parlor every evening when she is not out
at parties or lectures, and, as she spins street
yarn every morning, I cannot for the life of me
see what opportunity she takes to be lonesome.
But I do see that she gives herself no time to
keep her husband's shirts made up and in order;
and I find that I have no lack of employment,
for she has kept me sewing ever since I came.</p>

<p>"Sophy, dear," says I, the morning after my
arrival, "give me some sewing; I cannot be
idle, and have nothing but this knitting to do
for myself."</p>

<p>Whereupon she brought out a whole piece of
fine bleached cloth, and proposed that we should
amuse ourselves by making it into shirts for her
husband.</p>

<p>"Holton needs them so much," said she,
"and you are so kind as to offer your services,
aunty; it would cost so much to hire them done,
and his salary is so small now, you know, and
boarding so expensive."</p>

<p>And to work we began; but the truth is that
it is very little which Ann Sophia has done thus
far. Well, what is a single woman good for
unless to make herself generally useful? A
precious sight of twaddle have I read first and
last in the papers and magazines about the delights
and privileges of old-maidery. Delights
of a fiddlestick! Pulled hither and thither,
perhaps&mdash;as I have been&mdash;at the beck of married
brothers and sisters, and a score of idle nephews
and nieces; if you have a home of your own,
not allowed to stay at it in peace for more than
one week together. Sister Julia's children have
all got the measles, and Aunt Abigail must go
and take care of them; or brother Peter's wife
is dead, and Abigail must pack up and go to
keep house for him till she becomes attached to
the motherless tribe, and feels quite at home
among them, when he gets a new wife, and Abigail
departs just as she begins to be happy. To
crown all, when she puts her own house in order,
and has a nice lot of sweetmeats and pickles
made up, along comes a troop of relations, male<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
and female, young and old, to visit dear Aunt
Abigail and eat up all her stores, to say nothing
of completely kicking out the stair carpet. But
I am wandering from my subject&mdash;a thing which
I am apt to do.</p>

<p>The house is quiet now, and, having finished
one of Holton Sparks's shirts this evening, I
embrace the respite to retire to my own room.
After all, I do not feel like scolding about Ann
Sophia. The pleasant-tempered girl looks so
much like her mother, brother Peter's first wife;
I brought her up, too, at least till she was ten
years old, when her father married again. Her
chief fault is her youth, and she will get over
that, dear child.</p>

<p>However, to return, I cannot sleep till I have
expressed my indignation at the follies that have
been perpetrated in honor&mdash;rather should I say,
in dishonor&mdash;of All Fools' Day, hoping that you,
Mr. Editor, will lift your voice in favor of putting
a stop to such absurdities. In the first
place, I had scarcely risen, when I was myself
made the victim of imposition; for, while I was
dressing, there was a rap at the door, and I heard
Sparks's voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aunt Abigail, are you up? Here is a letter
postmarked Wimpleton. It came by the night
train, probably."</p>

<p>"As sure as fate," thought I, "there has
something dreadful happened at home." And,
being much agitated, I tore open the envelop in
great haste, without observing that the superscription
was not in brother Sam's hand, and
wondering why Sparks did not wait to learn the
nature of its tidings. As truly as I am a living
woman, there was nothing inside but a great
foolscap sheet, and on it these words, in staring
capitals&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"APRIL FOOL."</p>

<p>I could have cried, so vexed was I at first.
Then I felt thankful that no bad news had
actually reached me; for, during the brief moment
occupied in opening the letter, you can
scarcely imagine the many terrible things that
passed through my head. Mother had had a fit,
fallen down and broken her leg, though brother
Sam had promised me faithfully not to leave her
alone while I was gone; or that stupid Dutch
boy, who takes care of the cow and the fires,
had left live coals in the ash-box, and the house
was burned to the ground. Or Sam himself had
got one of those severe attacks of inflammatory
rheumatism, and nobody there but mother to
take care of him, and take his fretting into the
bargain, and she almost eighty years old. When
I recovered myself a little, I took that wretched
sheet of paper, and was on the point of penning
a dignified expression of my sentiments below
the odious words, and handing it in silent scorn
to my nephew-in-law at the breakfast-table.
But better feelings prevailed; I smoothed it
nicely in my portfolio, and am now scratching
this hasty epistle upon its surface, intending in
the morning to write it more legibly on some of
my own fair sheets of Bath.</p>

<p>A few among the follies of this tiresome day
have, I must acknowledge, given me a certain
sort of satisfaction. Holton Sparks has been
come up with himself; not by any means of
mine, I earnestly assure you, for, besides heartily
despising it, I cannot in any shape perpetrate
"April fooling." Sam often says that this is
because I am so matter-of-fact; but, matter-of-fact
or not, I trust that there is not enough
matter-of-folly in my composition to attempt
such performances. I always did abominate
practical jokes, and Sam knows <em>that;</em> yet the
jokes which that boy still puts upon me, though
I am three years older than himself, would be
deemed improbable.</p>

<p>Well, when the breakfast-bell rang this morning,
I went down stairs with an air as erect and
dignified as a woman of fif&mdash;&mdash;no matter&mdash;with
such a demeanor as one who has outlived the
fooleries of early youth should make habitual.
Holton Sparks is very fond of eggs, and invariably
takes the biggest on the dish. I observed
that our landlady directed the servant to hand
them first to Mr. Sparks, who was too intent on
securing his egg to notice her action. Indeed,
he never hesitates to help himself first, quite
regardless of the ladies who sit near, and even
of Ann Sophia. Holton is a tremendous eater,
seeming to think of nothing at table but disposing
of his food as rapidly and in as large quantities
as possible. The manner of this gentleman
is to place a large piece of nicely buttered toast
on his plate, pour the egg over it, pepper the
whole thoroughly, and swallow it as if the preparation
were some unpleasant dose that it is
his duty to dispatch. Mrs. Mashum, who is
altogether too much given to laughing, and too
volatile for her station, sat behind the coffee
urn shaking violently with suppressed mirth.
He broke the shell of his egg as usual, when,
behold, his plate was flooded with a dingy-looking
liquid, which proved to be warm dish-water.
On comprehending the joke, he sent it
away with an offended air, and made his breakfast
on beefsteak, without deigning to join in
the universal laugh. It seems that last evening
he laid a wager with Mrs. Mashum that she
could not succeed in playing him a trick, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
should be so constantly upon his guard during
All Fools' Day. The affair of the egg has put
him out of humor to such an extent that we
have been saved the infliction of any more jokes
at his hands. He has worn his dignity all day,
not even Ann Sophia succeeding in laughing or
coaxing him into laying it aside. I rather think
that he grudges the dollar which he will have to
lay out for the gloves, as Mrs. Mashum has won
the bet, and Ann Sophia assures him that a pair
of her own will not do by any means. He proposed
that expedient to settle the matter. Holton
<em>is</em> stingy. But his wife declared that such a
good joke deserved a pair of Alexander's best.
It is not because I approve of betting that I
mention this, for I hold the practice in great abhorrence.
It was only of a piece with the other
follies of the day, and shows up Holton Sparks
a little.</p>

<p>A small fire of fooling was kept up throughout
the morning. If the door-bell has been rung
once, it has forty times, by Mrs. Mashum's cub
of a boy, who would jerk the handle or toss up
his ball at the wire, and then run out of sight.
In going from my own room to my niece's, I
saw a sixpence on the floor, and, stooping down
to pick it up, found it fast. Congratulating myself
on not having been observed, I was passing
on, when that disagreeable urchin shouted, from
behind a door&mdash;</p>

<p>"April fool, old lady!"</p>

<p>He deserves to be sent to the House of Refuge.</p>

<p>Ann Sophia herself has put me out of all
manner of patience by saying, as I sat sewing at
the front window in her parlor, "Pray, Aunt
Abigail, whose carriage do you suppose that is?"
when no vehicle was in view but the milkman's.
Or, suddenly, she would exclaim, "What ladies
are those crossing the street?" when none were
anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>But the meanest of all was a very rude thing,
which she repeated several times upon different
persons, apparently delighted with its efficacy.
This was to rush up suddenly, and screaming
out, "See there!" throw her arm directly across
one's nose with so much force as to oblige that
organ to follow the direction of her outstretched
finger, whether or no. Such a sort of fooling
by compulsion struck me as particularly reprehensible.</p>

<p>"I'd try it on you, aunty," said the volatile
child, "if I were not afraid of scoring my arm."</p>

<p>Such an insinuation against my nose! Had
it been any one besides Sophy, I could not have
forgiven the speech. She is such a highty-tighty.</p>

<p>But one trick which she played was really
good, especially as its object was a man to whom
I have taken a huge dislike. He is an Irish
gentleman connected with some legal firm in
town, most desperately polite, with a very long
round nose and fiery red hair. He is continually
poking dishes at me across the table, and is fairly
oppressive with his attentions. Moreover,
he calls me "Mrs." perpetually. "Mrs.," indeed!
Intimating that I am old enough to be a
"Mrs.," if not one in fact. As he rises very
late, he never appears at breakfast with ourselves;
but at dinner we have the misery of his
presence. To-day, when we were almost through
with the first course, he entered with an air
much flushed and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"Are you ill, Mr. O'Killigan?" asked Mrs.
Mashum.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, madam," said he, with one
of his customary efforts at politeness. "But I
have been trying for a long while to shave, till
forced in despair to give up the attempt. The
deuce has got into my soap."</p>

<p>"You have forgotten that it is the first of
April. The day may have had some influence
upon your dressing-case," remarked one of the
ladies present.</p>

<p>"I declare, I have not thought of that," said
he, and, springing from the table, he ran to his
room, returning with something which he begged
the ladies to examine. It proved to be a thick,
fair slice of a raw potato, in size and color so
much like his own soap, which had been removed,
that he had detected no difference, except
that it refused to form a lather. This was
the work of my mischievous niece, who looked
at it very gravely, and remarked, with much
demureness&mdash;</p>

<p>"I always knew that you Irish were fond of
potatoes, but was not aware that you carried it
to such an excess as to shave with that vegetable."</p>

<p>It would have better pleased me had O'Killigan
been angry; but the Irishman took the joke,
and all the speeches made at his expense, with
entire good-humor, laughingly assuring the ladies
that he would be revenged before night.
And, as he knew not whom to suspect, he
adopted a course which involved most of us in
its consequences. When we retire for the night,
those who are not better provided equip themselves
with a candle, of which a supply stands
ready in the lower hall. Such a fuss as I had
with my light this evening! It went out as
soon as I reached my own door; and, after relighting
it several times by means of matches,
the tallow was exhausted, and I discovered that
the blackened remnant of wick was stuck into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
carrot. That miserable Irishman had enlisted
Biddy Flyn, the chambermaid, in his service,
and this afternoon they spent two whole hours
in the basement at their nefarious work, trimming
off carrots and giving them a very thin
coating of grease. Mrs. Mashum herself did
not escape, for, just as she began taking her
usual rounds to see that all was safe for the
night, her treacherous light went out, leaving
her in total darkness&mdash;in the lower regions, too,
for she was on the point of inspecting a keg of
mackerel in the cellar.</p>

<p>At this identical moment, having used up all
my matches in vain endeavors to light a candle,
which, like its manufacturer's locks, I had found
to be carroty, I was on my way to the kitchen
in pursuit of a more reliable means of illumination,
when I heard Mrs. Mashum scream out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bring a light, Biddy, for goodness sake! I
shall step into this rat-trap that you've set, if I
stir an inch in the dark."</p>

<p>And all the while the shameful Biddy stood
holding her sides, and laughing in a most unreasonable
way. Several persons were running
along the upper hall calling for lights, the ladies
in a sort of demi-toilet, and one of the young
men, a dry-goods clerk, who dresses his hair
with a curling-tongs, having on a black silk
night-cap. But the real culprit did not suffer,
after all, for Ann Sophia has her own solar
lamp.</p>

<p>While these distressing events were transpiring,
that mean Irishman, with his big nose and
red head, sat in the parlor, as cool as possible,
reading the "London News" by the light of a
brilliant camphene lamp. I wonder his hair did
not ignite and cause an explosion. It would
have served him quite right.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Mrs. Mashum is not at all
offended either at O'Killigan or his accomplice,
but has enjoyed their mischief in a way to me
utterly unaccountable. I suppose Sam would
say that she knows how to take a joke; for my
part, they are things which I do not wish to
know how to take myself; I wash my hands of
all participation in such knowledge.</p>

<p>I have obtained a lamp that shall last till I
have finished this narrative of to-day's outrageous
proceedings. On passing the parlor-door, I
heard that disagreeable O'Killigan say to his
landlady, in reply to some of her pretended
threats of punishment&mdash;</p>

<p>"At any rate, my good Mrs. Mashum, you
cannot arrest me for incendiary attempts; I
have made such laudable exertions to put out
the flames in the house."</p>

<p>Impudent fellow! I had a mind to say something
about the blaze on his own head; but I
forbore, passing on in offended silence.</p>

<p>Now, my dear Mr. Godey, set a good example,
and lead the way in a reform of these
abuses, as you have in so many other praiseworthy
undertakings. Frown upon these April
fooleries, especially as levelled at the peace and
quiet of respectable single women. If my letter
is too late to take effect this present season,
please give it due notice before a twelvemonth
hence. You will thus oblige and gratify your
friend and constant reader,</p>

<p class="center">A<span class="smcapa">BIGAIL</span> S<span class="smcapa">NIPE</span>.</p>

<p><em>Postscript.</em> I shall go home to-morrow, and
finish Holton Sparks's last new shirt in the pleasant
seclusion afforded by my own hearthstone.
I cannot endure the thought of sitting at the
table in this house any longer, opposite that
dreadful O'Killigan, hearing him crack his dry
jokes while he rubs his chin with his thumb and
forefinger. To be obliged to listen when he
comments on the mishaps of this evening would
surely set me into a nervous fit. It strikes me
that I have read in one of Sam's old books&mdash;"Sal"
somebody's writings&mdash;of an elderly lady
who "died of a Frenchman." If I were to stay
here much longer, I should assuredly die of this
middle-aged Irishman.</p>

<p>Depend upon it, I shall not breathe a word to
Sam of my trials at Sophy's boarding-house, in
consequence of the inmates all making fools of
themselves and me on the F<span class="smcapa">IRST OF</span> A<span class="smcapa">PRIL</span>.</p>

<h2>INTELLECTUAL ENDOWMENTS OF
CHILDREN.</h2>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">N</span> extremely intelligent boy, of about twelve
years of age, was once brought to the late Dr.
Deville, an English phrenologist, for examination,
by a parent who was very proud of the intellectual
endowments of his child. Dr. Deville
gave his opinion of the boy's character, at the
same time cautioning the father of the dangerous
course he was pursuing. But the father's reply
was, "All that other boys considered labor and
hard study were merely child's play to him;
and that his studies could not be hurtful to him&mdash;he
enjoyed them so much." Again Dr. Deville
endeavored to save the child, but the father
would not attend to the warning. Two years
from that time he again called on Dr. Deville,
and, in reply to his inquiries about the child,
burst into tears, and stated that the boy was an
idiot.</p>

<h2>GODEY'S COURSE OF LESSONS IN DRAWING.</h2>


<p class="p6">LESSON V.</p>

<p>The outline of the stem and the curve of the
scroll of Fig. 54 must first be drawn, the distances
and proportions of the various parts being
carefully observed. In sketching the scroll in
Fig. 55, the eye alone will be the guide, the
directions and distances of the various parts being
marked off before filling in the details.</p>

<p>The method of drawing the rosette forming
part of the scroll shown in Fig. 57 is displayed
in Fig. 56, the circle being drawn first.</p>

<p>In sketching Fig. 58, the direction of the
curve must first be ascertained, its due proportions
noted, thereafter filling in the details.</p>

<p>The stem, leaves, flower, and buds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
wall-flower in Fig. 59 will afford an interesting
example for practice at this stage of progress;
the stem, its length and direction, should first
be drawn, the position of the leaves, &amp;c. marked
thereon, and the details thereafter filled in.</p>

<p>The sketch in Fig. 60, which represents the
stem, leaves, and flower of the yellow crowfoot,
will be drawn in the same way as above.</p>

<p>The flower of the honeysuckle in Fig. 61
affords a good example for free pencil-sketching.
The stem should be drawn first, then an outline
made which will touch all the exterior parts of
the sketch, as in Figs. 44 and 52; the distances
of the leaves should next be drawn on this, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
the details put in. The pupil should endeavor
to copy this example correctly; it may appear
very difficult, but, by a careful attention to the
rules we have given, and a little determination
to "try again," if perchance she should once or
twice fail, the difficulty will soon vanish.</p>

<h2>DRESS&mdash;AS A FINE ART.</h2>

<p class="p5">BY MRS. MERRIFIELD.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> look forward hopefully to a day when
art-education will be extended to all ranks;
when a knowledge of the beautiful will be added
to that of the useful; when good taste, based
upon real knowledge and common sense, will
dictate our fashions in dress as in other things.
We have schools of art to reform our taste in
pottery, hardware, and textile fabrics, not to
speak of the higher walks of art, painting, sculpture,
and architecture. The handle of a jug,
the stem of a wine-glass, the design for dress
silks or lace veils, will form the subjects of lectures
to the students of the various schools of
design; disquisitions are written on the important
question whether the ornamental designs
should represent the real form of objects,
or only give a conventional representation of
them, while the study of the human figure, the
masterpiece of creation, is totally neglected, except
by painters and sculptors. We hope that
the study of form will be more extended, that it
will be universal, that it will, in fact, enter into
the general scheme of education, and that we
shall hereafter see as much pains bestowed in
improving by appropriate costume the figure
which nature has given us, as we do now in distorting
it by tight stays, narrow and high-heeled
shoes, and all the other deformities and eccentricities
of that many-faced monster, fashion.
The economy of the frame, and the means of
preserving it in health and beauty, should form
an integral part of education. There can be no
true beauty without health, and how can we
hope to secure health if we are ignorant of the
means of promoting it, or if we violate its precepts
by adopting absurd and pernicious fashions?</p>

<p>Surely it is not too much to hope that dress-makers
will hereafter attend the schools of design,
to study the human form, and thence learn
to appreciate its beauties, and to clothe it with
appropriate dress, calculated to display its beauties
to the greatest advantage, and to conceal its
defects&mdash;the latter with the reservation we have
already noticed. We hope, also, that the shoe-maker
will learn to model the shoe upon the
true form of the foot.</p>

<p>Manufacturers are now convinced of the importance
and utility of schools of design, and
whether the article hereafter to be produced be
a cup and saucer, a fender, a pattern for a dress
or for furniture, for a service of plate or dia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>mond
tiara, it is thought proper that the pupil,
as a preliminary course that cannot be dispensed
with, should commence with the study of the
human figure. Yet, is not dress an art-manufacture
as well as a cup and saucer, or a tea-board?
Are there less skill and talent, less taste
required to clothe the form which we are told
is made after God's own image, than to furnish
an apartment? Why should not dressmakers
and tailors attend the schools of design as well
as those artisans who are intended to be employed
in what are now called art-manufactures?
Why should not shoe-makers be taught the
shape and movements of the foot? If this were
the case, we are satisfied that an immediate and
permanent improvement would be the consequence
in our style of dress.</p>

<p>We believe that many portrait painters stipulate
that they shall be allowed to dictate the
dress, at least as regards the arrangement of the
colors, of their sitters; the reason of this is that
the painter's selection of dress and color is based
upon the study of the figure and complexion of
the individual, or the knowledge of the effects
of contrast and harmony of lines, tissues, and
colors, while the models which are presented for
his imitation too frequently offer to his view a
style of dress, both as regards form and color,
which sets the rules of harmony at defiance.
Now, only suppose that the dress-maker had
the painter's knowledge of form and harmony
of lines and colors, what a revolution would
take place in dress? We should no longer see
the tall and the short, the slender and the stout,
the brown and the fair, the old and the young,
dressed alike, but the dress would be adapted to
the individual; and we believe that, were the
plan of study we recommend generally adopted,
this purpose might always be effected without
the sacrifice of what is now the grand desideratum
in dress&mdash;novelty.</p>

<p>The reasons why the art of dressmaking has
not hitherto received the attention which it deserves,
are to be sought for in the constitution
of society. The branches of manufacture which
require a knowledge of design, such as calico-printing,
silk and ribbon-weaving, porcelain and
pottery, and hardware manufactures, are conducted
on a large scale by men of wealth and
talent, who, if they would compete successfully
with rival manufactures, find it necessary to
study and apply to their own business all the
improvements in science with which their intercourse
with society gives them an opportunity
of becoming acquainted. It is quite otherwise
with dressmaking. A woman is at the head of
every establishment of this kind a woman generally of limited education and attainments, from
whom cannot be expected either liberality of
sentiment or enlarged views, but who possibly
possesses some tact and discrimination of character,
which enable her to exercise a kind of
dictatorial power in matters of dress over her
customers; these customers are scarcely better
informed on the subject than herself.</p>

<p>The early life of the dressmaker is spent in a
daily routine of labor with the needle, and, when
she becomes a mistress in her turn, she exacts
from her assistants the same amount of daily
labor that was formerly expected from herself.
Work, work, work with the needle from almost
childhood, in the same close room from morning
to night, and not unfrequently from night to
morning also, is the everlasting routine of the
monotonous life of the dressmakers. They are
working for bread, and have no leisure to attend
to the improvement of the mind, and the want
of this mental cultivation is apparent in the
articles they produce by their labor. When one
of the young women who attend these establishments
to learn the trade thinks she has had
sufficient experience, she leaves the large establishment
and sets up in business on her own
account. In this new situation, she works
equally hard, and has therefore no time for improving
her mind and taste. Of the want of
this, however, she is not sensible, because she
can purchase for a trifle all the newest patterns,
and the thought never enters her poor little head
that the same fashion may not suit all her customers.
This defective education of the dressmakers,
or rather their want of knowledge of
the human form, is one of the great causes of
the prevalence of the old fashion of tight-lacing.
It is so much easier to make a closely-fitting
body suit over a tight stay than it is on the
pliant and yielding natural form, in which, if
one part be drawn a little too tight, or the contrary,
the body of the dress is thrown out of
shape. Supposing, on the other hand, the fit to
be exact, it is so difficult to keep such a tight-fitting
body in its place on the figure without securing
its form by whalebones, that it is in vain
to expect the stays to become obsolete until the
tight-fitting bodice is also given up.</p>

<p>This will never take place until not only the
ladies who are to be clothed, but the dressmakers
shall make the human form their study, and direct
their efforts to set off their natural advantages
by attending to the points which are their
characteristic beauties. A long and delicate
throat, falling shoulders, not too wide from point
to point, a flat back, round chest, wide hips;
these are the points which should be developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
by the dress. Whence it follows that every
article of dress which shortens the throat, adds
height or width to the shoulders, roundness to
the back, or flatness to the chest, must be radically
wrong in principle, and unpleasant and
repulsive in effect. In the same manner, whatever
kind of dress adds to the height of a figure
already too tall and thin, or detracts from the
apparent height of the short and stout, must be
avoided. These things should form the study
of the dressmaker.</p>

<p>As society is now constituted, however, the
dressmaker has not, as we have already observed,
leisure to devote to studies of the necessity and
importance of which she is still ignorant. The
reform must be begun by the ladies themselves.
They must acquire a knowledge of form, and of
the principles of beauty and harmony, and so
exercise a controlling influence over the dressmakers.
By this means a better taste will be
created, and the dressmakers will at length discover
their deficiency in certain guiding principles,
and will be driven at last to resort to similar
studies. But in this case a startling difficulty
presents itself&mdash;the poor dressmaker is at present
over-worked: how can she find leisure to
attend the schools of design, or even pursue, if
she had the ability, the necessary studies at
home? A girl is apprenticed to the trade at the
age of thirteen or fourteen, she works at it all
her life, rising early, and late taking rest, and
what is the remuneration of her daily toil of
twelve hours? Eighteenpence, or at most two
shillings a day, with her board! As she reckons
the value of the latter at a shilling, it follows
that the earnings of a dressmaker, in the best
period of her life, who goes out to work, could
not exceed 15<em>s.</em>, or at the most 18<em>s.</em> a week, if
she did not, at the hazard of her health&mdash;which,
indeed, is frequently sacrificed&mdash;work at home
before she begins, and after she has finished her
day's work abroad. The carpenter or house-painter
does not work harder, or bring to bear
on his employment greater knowledge than the
poor dressmaker, yet he has 4<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> a day without
his board, while she has only what is equivalent
to 2<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em> or 3<em>s.!</em> What reason can be assigned
why a woman's work, if equally well
done, should not be as well paid as that of a
man? A satisfactory reason has yet to be given;
the fact, however, is indisputable that women are
not in general so well paid for their labor as men.</p>

<h2>LETTERS LEFT AT THE PASTRY-COOK'S:</h2>

<p class="center">BEING THE CLANDESTINE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN KITTY CLOVER AT SCHOOL, AND HER "DEAR,
DEAR FRIEND" IN TOWN.</p>

<p class="p5">EDITED BY HORACE MAYHEW.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h3>THE FIFTH LETTER LEFT.</h3>

<p class="center">(<em>Written on copy-book paper, apparently left by hand.</em>)</p>

<p class="center">SHOWING WHAT KITTY THOUGHT OF GOVERNESSES
IN GENERAL, AND OF ONE IN
PARTICULAR.</p>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">ELLY</span>, dearest, I have formed a great determination.
Nothing shall ever induce me to become
that poor, absurd, ill-used creature, called
a governess. I would starve sooner, or make
shirts (which is pretty nearly the same thing),
or emigrate and marry the first savage I met, or
be a "touter" at a bonnet shop, or even go into
service at a cheap lodging-house; anything,
Nelly, sooner than be turned into that hopeless,
spiritless, friendless being a governess seems
destined by nature, or society, to be.</p>

<p>A governess in a private family is bad enough,
but then she is not totally deprived of the comforts
of home. She has a room, or at least a bed,
entirely to herself, and her meals are generally
the same as those of the family. Besides, a
certain degree of respect is always paid to her.
The servants are obliged to treat her with
civility, <em>at all events in the presence of their mistresses;</em>
and the mistresses are compelled to show
her a little attention, if it is only done to set a
good example to their servants. Then, again,
their "young charges" cannot invariably be
amusing themselves at her expense. They cannot
always be teasing her. When they are
taken out for an airing in the carriage, or when
they are brought down after dinner with their
shiny faces and glossy ringlets, or whenever
there is company, or their parents and strangers
are present, the governess enjoys a brief respite
from that system of petty tyrannies she is the
untiring victim of elsewhere. She has her few
pleasures, though perhaps they may come at long
straggling intervals; she has her distractions,
her excitements in moving about in the world,
and going to places of public amusements, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
occasionally she knows what it is to enjoy the
sweet success of rivalry&mdash;for have we not seen,
Nelly, many a poor neglected governess who was
doing the work of a musician at the piano, without
his wages, receive in the course of the evening
more attention than the fine young ladies
themselves who were the worshipped idols of the
establishment?</p>

<p>But the governess in a girls' school has a very
different life of it, Nelly. She hasn't a moment
to herself. She is the first to rise and the
last to go to bed. She hasn't even the privacy
of a bedroom to herself, for she is obliged to
sleep in the same room as the girls, to look after
them. The only privacy she knows is when
she creeps into bed and draws the curtains round
her. Our play-hours are no play-hours to her;
rather on the contrary, for then her torments
really begin, and only end when the bell rings
again for class. She is the target at which every
little chit fires her fun, and thinks she has a
perfect right to do so. She is the only game at
which the girls never tire of playing, and to see
how they enjoy it you would imagine there was
no amusement like it. It is true, Nelly, I have
not seen much misery yet, and hope I never
shall; but I can hardly imagine anything in this
world <em>more miserable than a school governess on a
half-holiday</em>.</p>

<p>Why, look at poor Blight. I have only to look
upon her to feel for the sufferings of the whole
class. Her nature seems to be sun-dried. She
never smiles, and there is such an air of resignation
about her, such a tone of despair that
runs through all her words and smallest movements,
that it is perfectly clear Hope never whispers
into her ear any of those soft motherly words
which soothe the agony of one's heart and lull
it quietly off to sleep.</p>

<p>She may justly be called our "mistress of all
work." She does a little of everything; she helps
the smallest girls to dress; takes the junior
pupils; hears the reading; sees to the wardrobes;
gives out the linen; teaches needlework; and
superintends the Saturday night's cleaning; in
short, she is expected, as they say of servants, "to
make herself generally useful," which means,
in our instance, that she is worked to death by
everybody, and spared by nobody; besides being
teased, deceived, bullied, and ridiculed by every
one who has a fancy that way; and for leading a
life like this, she only gets 16<em>l.</em> a year, and her
board and lodging during the holidays!</p>

<p>Snapp (another of our teachers) smiles at
Blight's old-fashioned learning. She says it is
quite out of date, and only fit for a charity school.
Mademoiselle (the French teacher) quizzes her
dress, and makes fun of her melancholy, and talks
of her contemptuously, as, "<em>ça</em>," which I am told
is the same as if you were speaking of a cook,
or a poor relation, and called her "it." Fraulein
(the German mistress) mimics her, and laughs
over her patient endurance and old-maidish
manners.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that poor Blight's appearance
affords plenty of temptation for this cruel
ridicule. She is certainly very ugly, and no one
ever loses an opportunity of telling her so. The
worst is, the example set by the schoolmistress is
followed with the greatest zest by the schoolgirls,
who indulge in all kinds of practical jokes
at her expense. She is unfortunately very short-sighted,
and consequently they are always hiding
her spectacles, or else rubbing the glasses over
with butter or ink. No one considers there is
any harm in this, for the girls have grown to
look upon Blight as "fair game;" and if any one
can put her into a passion, it is considered "rare
fun," and thought just as harmless as throwing
bread-pills at one another when the mistress's
back is turned. When there is no other amusement
going on, the cry is always raised, "Let's go
and tease Blight," and you see the whole school
rushing forward as eagerly as if a gypsy suddenly
appeared at the play-ground gate to tell us our
fortunes. But if any one is in trouble, Blight is
the first to screen her. If any girl is ill, Blight
will sit up with her all night, and will pet and
nurse the little sufferer until she almost fancies
herself at home; and when the little invalid has
grown well again, and has recovered the use of
her tongue and fingers, Blight never says a word
about the ungrateful return, but bears it all like
a martyr, which, in truth, she really is. Ugly
as she is, I really think there are times when I
could <em>throw my arms round her neck, and kiss
her for her goodness</em>.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you all the nicknames which
they have for her face and person, nor would it
altogether be agreeable for you, Nelly, I think
to hear them. Suffice it to say, the poor thing,
is very old&mdash;<em>thirty-nine</em>, if she is a day; and she
has the funniest little head of hair, every hair
appearing to be pulled as tight, and to be almost
as wide apart, as the strings of a harp. The top
of her head is mounted with a round knot of hair
no bigger than the worsted ball you see on a
Scotch cap. It's a wonder to me she doesn't wear
a wig or a cap of some sort, though perhaps it
would be too dangerous, as every one would
undoubtedly be trying to pull it off. The girls declare
no one can recollect her having a new gown.
Every quarter a very thin, snuff-brown silk, on a
very stiff lining, is brought out as Sunday best;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
but it is only the old one turned and altered a bit,
for that little wicked thing, Jessie Joy, put a drop
of ink on one of the breadths on purpose to find
it out; and there it is still, journeying about
backwards and forwards, first in front and then
behind; now on the top, just under her chin, and
next down at the bottom, sweeping the floor, precisely
as the faded silk is twisted or turned to hide
the creases and the ravages of old age. The girls
calculate the period they have been at school by
this venerable gown; and it's no unusual thing
to hear them, when disputing about any particular
date, settling it at once by referring to the
age of Miss Blight's brown silk, saying, "I recollect
very well it was in the ninth quarter of
Blight's Sunday gown;" and a reference to a
date of this kind is considered as indisputable
as to a Family Bible, or an old almanac.</p>

<p>But these are small matters, Nelly, which I
am half ashamed to tell you, for under this poor
garment there is a heart of so much goodness as
to make us wonder at the strange hiding-places
in which virtue sometimes delights in lurking,
as if from modesty it had taken every precaution
not to be found out. What do you think, Nelly?
I am told by Meggy that poor Blight supports an
old bedridden mother! She has no positive proof
of this, but she is morally sure of it. This, then,
accounts for the reason why the poor governess
is always working so hard&mdash;never resting from
crocheting purses, and knitting antimacassars
sufficient to cover all the sofas in the world. If
you ask her for whom she makes this extraordinary
quantity (you can't think, Nell, how
quickly and beautifully she works), she simply
replies, her pale face becoming paler, "<em>for a
dear friend;</em>" and that is all we can get out of
her to reward our vulgar curiosity. This must
be the truth, for at all hours, both early and late,
has she got a needle in her hand. There is a
story that she wakes up sometimes in the middle
of the night, and works whilst the girls around
her are sleeping. But no one knows the cause
of her excessive industry, and I really think she
would be miserable if it were known, and her
fingers would not ply their work of love half so
nimbly if she suspected that the girls, as they
watched her with such fixed curiosity, were acquainted
with the sacred object for which she
was toiling. It is a puzzle when or where she
sells all the things she finishes, and no one exactly
likes to find out, though one or two attempts
have been made, but always ending, I am happy
to say, in the most complete failure. It makes
me sad to watch her anxiety when there is a
postman's knock at the door. She starts up in
her seat, and pauses for a while in her work (the
only pause it ever knows), until she gives out
the letters; and then you would pity her with
all your heart to see how disappointed she is&mdash;what
a vacancy of hope falls like a dark shadow
upon her face&mdash;when she learns that there is not
one for her! Though, when there is a letter, it
is scarcely any better. She sighs heavily, looks
sometimes at a little locket she carries in her
breast, and hurries on with her work quicker
than ever, as if the purse she was finishing was
to contain her own money instead of somebody
else's, and she had so much that she wanted the
use of it immediately.</p>

<p>If you have any fancy-work you want doing
(any braces or cigar-cases you wish to give away
as presents), will you send it to me, Nelly, and
I will ask Blight, if I can do so without offending
her, to do it for me?</p>

<p>I'm obliged to finish my letter, Nelly, for the
fact is I have been writing the latter part of it
in our bedroom with a piece of wax candle I
took out of a candlestick there was in the hall,
and there is only just sufficient left to enable me
to scramble into bed, and to assure you how
dearly you are loved by</p>

<p class="center">Yours affectionately,<br />
K<span class="smcapa">ITTY</span> C<span class="smcapa">LOVER</span>.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;I intend that my bootlace shall come
undone somewhere about the grocer's, when we
are out a walking to-morrow, so that I may lag
behind, and drop this in the post unobserved.
Oh! dear&mdash;the candle's gone out. What sh&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHARITY ENVIETH NOT.</h2>

<p class="p6">BY ALICE B. NEAL.</p>


<p>"You don't say so!"</p>

<p>"True as the Gospel, <em>Miss</em> Snelling. That
velvet cloak of hers&mdash;<em>she</em> calls it a Talma&mdash;cost
every cent of twenty-five dollars. Then there's
her bonnet&mdash;that came from New York, too;
<em>Miss</em> Dunn's work ain't good enough for her of
late years. Well, that bonnet couldn't be
bought for less'n eight dollars. Why, the ribbon
must be four and six a yard, not to speak of
the feathers. Then there's that new plaid silk,
you know, and that French merino; neither of
'em less'n twelve shillings, and that's the way
she dresses. Time was when she was glad
enough to get me to sew for her. I've had her
beg, and beg, and <em>beseech</em> me to give her a day,
or even half a day, in my spring hurry; and
now she's got a seamstress, as she calls that
stuck-up girl, that sets in the settin'-room all
day. She makes the children's clothes, and
<em>her'n</em> are cut and fixed in New York, when they
ain't made there."</p>

<p>"She's dreadful extravagant for a church
member," said Mrs. Snelling, with a sigh, as
she turned herself slowly round before the little
looking-glass. She was having a lining fitted
by the village dressmaker, Miss Prime, and a
merino dress she had worn two years was partly
ripped up on the chair by the window. It was
the only dressmaking she had on hand for the
season. It was a hard winter, and, what with
the sickness of the children, and Mr. Snelling
losing so much time by the frost, their means
were unusually limited. No wonder that she
thought of the ease and plenty of the rich manufacturer's
household with a feeling of envy. She
did not know it, though. She was a plain, good-hearted
person naturally, struggling on to do her
duty through the discouragement of ill health,
ailing children, and very narrow means; but
she could not help thinking Mrs. Hubbard was
getting worldly and extravagant as, year by year,
her household arrangements and personal expenses
increased.</p>

<p>Only the day before, at meeting, she could not
fix her attention upon the sermon for looking at
the velvet Talma worn for the first time by her
old friend and still kind neighbor, Mrs. Hubbard.
They were members of the same church,
of which Mr. Hubbard was the most liberal supporter.
He gave according to his means, and,
at the same time, desired his wife and family to
dress and live as became his altered position and
prospects.</p>

<p>"Time was when she had to work hard
enough," continued Miss Prime, pinching in a
side seam in the endeavor to produce the hour-glass
shape, orthodox when she "learned her
trade." "I remember when they first set up
housekeeping, and she had to do her own work
as well as other people, and her own sewing,
too. Now I don't believe she takes a needle in
her hand from morning till night, while you
and I, <em>Miss</em> Snelling, don't git <em>many</em> play spells."</p>

<p>The leaven of uncharitableness worked on in
Mrs. Snelling's heart.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid there isn't much spiritual growth,
Miss Prime. The cares of this world choke the
seed." Poor woman! she thought it was only
an interest in her neighbor's best good that
prompted such a constant review of her conduct.
"People that have their hearts set on dress and
high living can't have much time for better
things."</p>

<p>"That's what I think. How do you like
them <em>bask</em> waists, Miss Snelling? I hear they're
all the fashion in New York. Miss Dunn said
she'd try an' git me a pattern when she went
down in the spring. I wouldn't ask Miss Hubbard
to lend me hers to look at for nothing in
the world. How am I goin' to get out new
backs, Miss Snelling?"</p>

<p>"There's the cape, you see."</p>

<p>"Why, so there is! I never calculated the
cape. I was studyin' an' contrivin' all the while
you was to breakfast. Says I, 'Miss Snelling'll
have to have them backs pieced, and then
everybody in town'll know it's been made
over.'"</p>

<p>As if everybody in Mrs. Snelling's community
would not have known and noticed, under any
circumstances, that her brown merino of two
winters ago had been turned and made up again
for her best dress. She had set her heart, early
in the fall, on a new style of plaids, for sale at
Brown &amp; Chapins; but the doctor's bill was so
much larger than she expected, she was obliged
to give it up. The sacrifice had cost her many
hours of calculation, alternate resolves, and reconsiderations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
Every purchase that she made,
indeed, was of necessity turned over and over in
her mind for weeks.</p>

<p>Miss Prime went on with her fitting by the
window, and Mrs. Snelling with her task of
washing up the breakfast-dishes, "jogging the
cradle" with one foot, every now and then, as
her youngest child stirred in his morning nap.</p>

<p>"That was a lucky thought, that cape." Miss
Prime resumed her thimble and her conversation
together. "It don't seem to be worn as much
as the rest, neither."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't; I only kept it for very cold
days. I thought of it in church, Sunday, right
in the middle of the sermon. Queer, wasn't it?
I was so dreadfully afraid you couldn't get it
out. So, as soon as I came home, I took it out
and looked at it; sure enough, it was the very
thing."</p>

<p>"I see Miss James has got a new cloak this
winter. She hain't worn hers more than three
winters, to my knowledge. Well, these rich
people are jist as worldly, for all I see, as if they
wasn't professors." Miss Prime was one of the
most constant attendants of the church prayer-meetings,
and saw "no beam in her own eyes."</p>

<p>"Time was, as you say, Miss Prime, when
we were all plain people together, with good
feelings towards each other. I think of it very
often&mdash;the days when Susan Hubbard and I
used to send our little presents to each other
New Year's, and be neighborly all along. That
was before the Jameses moved here, or lawyer
Martin's people. She's so intimate with them
now she hasn't got any time for old friends.
Many and many's the time I've sent her things
right off my table; and, when her Jane had the
scarlet fever, I sat up with her night after night.
But I don't mind that. What I look at is
Christian professors being so taken up with
dress, and going about, but dress particularly.
It don't <em>look</em> right, and it isn't, according to
Scripture."</p>

<p>It was a wearisome, fatiguing day to Mrs.
Snelling, who did the whole work of her
household. Her oldest son was learning his
father's trade, and the dinner for the two had to
be on the table precisely at twelve, for they had
but an hour's nooning. So, scarcely were the
breakfast things cleared away, when there were
the meat and vegetables to prepare for "a boiled
dinner;" and twice she was obliged to stand and
be pinned up in the thick jean lining Miss Prime
was fitting with unexampled tightness. The
afternoon was no better; she had Tuesday's
ironing to finish, her little boy was sick and
fretful; though four years old, and very heavy,
he required to be nursed and tended as if he had
been a baby. She wanted to sew with Miss
Prime; but, no sooner would she get her needle
threaded, and her thimble on, than some new
demand would be made upon her time, and so
the short afternoon passed before she could
stitch up a seam, and tea must be ready by dark.
Besides all this, Miss Prime was disposed to
continue her conversation with very little pause
or stint, discussing the affairs of the neighborhood
and the church with a train of moral, religious,
and <em>personal</em> reflections. Every one
knows how fatiguing it is to be expected to
listen to such a discourse, and respond in the
right place, even when the mind is unoccupied;
and then the dress did not look nearly so well
as Mrs. Snelling had figured it in her mind, the
new pieces being several shades darker than the
main body of the material. More discouraging
than all, it needed "finishing off" when seven
o'clock sounded the signal for the conference
meeting Miss Prime would not miss on any
account.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind staying over my time jist
to give you a helpin' hand, if it wasn't church
meetin' night; but, you know, it's very important
all should be there that can. To be
sure, <em>Miss</em> Hubbard is so took up with other
things now, she never goes; and, though <em>Miss</em>
James joined by letter when <em>she</em> came, she's
never been to a business meeting. For my part,
I think we've got just as good a right to vote in
church meetin' as the men, and speak, too, if
we want to, though Deacon Smith has set his
face against it of late years. So, you see, I'll
have to go; and there's only the facing to face
down, and them side seams to stitch up, and the
hooks and eyes to go on. The sleeves are all
ready to baste in&mdash;oh, and there's the bones;
but bones are nothing to put in&mdash;especially as
John Lockwood is to be dealt with to-night for
going to the theatre last time he was in New
York. For my part, I never did put much faith
in his religion&mdash;and the more some of us stay
away, the more the rest of us ought to go. Don't
forget to take in that shoulder seam a little.
For my part, I think his sister ought to be labored
with for singing such songs as she does on
the piano. Clear love songs, and plays <em>opera
pieces</em>, Miss Allen says. Now which is the
worst, <em>I'd</em> like to know, going to the theatre or
playing opera pieces? <em>Miss</em> Hubbard's Jane
does that, when she's home in vacations, though.
That piece under the arm don't look so <em>very</em> bad,
<em>Miss</em> Snelling&mdash;there ain't more'n two hours'
work, any way."</p>

<p>Two hours' work, to a person who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
scarcely get time to do her mending from week
to week, was no trifle. Mrs. Snelling wavered
for a little while between the accumulating pile
of dilapidated under-clothes in the willow basket
and the unfinished dress; but the dress must be
done before New Year's day, now close at hand,
and she lighted another lamp, and drew her little
workstand up to the fire, as the clock again
struck eight. Her mind had opened itself to
discontented thoughts in the morning, and "the
enemy had come in like a flood," until all the
brightness of her life had been swept out of
sight. She saw only the successive woes of ill
health, loss, and wearing anxiety which had
rolled over them in the past, and a blank, dreary
prospect for the future. Her very occupation
reminded her of it. If she could have afforded
Miss Prime's assistance two days instead of one,
she might have got ahead in her sewing a little;
now here was another drawback, and she had so
little time. And "there was Susan Hubbard;
but, then, <em>she</em> did not give up everything to dress
and display, thank goodness! as Susan Hubbard
did, bringing scandal in the church, and setting
herself up over everybody."</p>

<p>A knock at the front door was a fresh annoyance;
for the work had to be put down again,
the sick boy quieted, before Mrs. Snelling went
shivering through the cold, narrow hall to answer
it.</p>

<p>The neighborly visitor was no other than Mrs.
Hubbard; "and no fire except in the kitchen,"
was Mrs. Snelling's first thought, as she recognized
her with a mixed feeling of gratification,
"hard thoughts," and curiosity. Certainly it
was a curious coincidence that the person who
had formed the subject of her thoughts and conversation,
so much of the day, should suddenly
appear.</p>

<p>"Don't mind me," Mrs. Hubbard said, pleasantly,
stepping on before her old neighbor.
"This way, I suppose?" And she led the way
to the kitchen herself, thus avoiding the necessity
of an apology on the part of Mrs. Snelling.
"How bright and cheerful a cook stove looks,
after all! and your kitchen always was as neat
as wax. We never used to keep but one fire,
you know." This last was an unfortunate allusion.
Mrs. Snelling's softening face grew coldly
rigid at what she considered an attempt to
patronize her.</p>

<p>"Poor folks <em>had to</em>," she said, taking up her
work and stitching away vigorously.</p>

<p>"I haven't forgotten old times, Jane," Mrs.
Hubbard went on, not caring to notice the ungracious
tone in which this remark was made,
"when we were all beginning the world together.
You seem to, though, for then you used
to run in and see me, and I was thinking to-night
you haven't been up to our house since
October."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snelling began to say something about
"not going where she was not wanted;" but it
died away lower and lower, when she remembered
Mrs. Hubbard had been in twice since
then.</p>

<p>"I know you have a great deal to keep you
at home; I know how it used to be when my
children were little. You didn't let me pay
three visits to your one then, Jane." Mrs. Hubbard
drew her thimble from her pocket and took
up the top piece of mending from the big willow
basket, in the most natural manner. "This is
to go so, isn't it?" said she. "I can work and
talk, too, you know. Mr. Hubbard has gone to
church meeting; but I don't think it's exactly
our place to attend to church discipline, we women
are so apt to make a bad matter worse by
talking it over among each other, and to people
that it doesn't concern. So I thought I'd just
run in sociably, and bring my thimble, as we
used to do for each other."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snelling would have said, half an hour
ago, that she was completely fortified against
Mrs. Hubbard's advances, in what shape soever;
but she began to find a mist gathering in her
eyes, as that old kindness and affection came
stealing back again in recollection.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Hubbard was a wise woman, and
she knew that a friend aggrieved was hard to
win, whether the offence had been intentional
or not.</p>

<p>"It's pretty hard work to live right, isn't it?"
she said, verging round again to the old subject,
after a little talk about the roads and the weather.
"Every lot in life has its trials. I used
to look at rich people, and think they hadn't a
care in the world; but, now Mr. Hubbard has
done so well, we have to live differently and
dress differently, and there's no end to looking
after things. I used to work hard all day, and,
when the children were asleep in the evening,
sit down comfortably to sew or read; but now
there's something or somebody to see to to the
last minute. To be sure, as far as dress is concerned,
I don't think half so much of it as I
used to, when I had to plan and contrive about
every cent. Why, I often used to find myself
planning about my sewing in sermon-time, if
you will believe it, and how I should get the
girls two dresses out of one of mine. To be
sure, I have no such temptations now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snelling looked up suddenly, as the recollection
of her Sunday plan about the cape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
came into her mind. Could it be that to <em>Him,
into whom all hearts are open</em>, she had been the
less sincere worshipper of the two?</p>

<p>"I should like to try a little prosperity, by
way of a change," she said, more pleasantly
than she had last spoken, but still with bitterness
beneath. "I'm tired of slaving."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jane!" Mrs. Hubbard said, quickly,
"don't choose&mdash;don't choose your trials. I used
to say that very thing, and that it was all well
enough for rich people to preach." Mrs. Snelling
saw the painful expression that crossed her
friend's face, and the current report of young
Robert Hubbard's dissipation came into her
mind. "Everybody has their own troubles;
some don't stand out as plain as others, and
don't get so much pity. Rich people get very
little, and they have hard work enough to bring
up their children right, and to live in peace and
charity with all. I've got so now I only ask
for patience to bear the trial of the time, instead
of praying to have it changed, and thinking that
I could bear any other better."</p>

<p>The two women sewed in silence for a little
while; each heart knew its own bitterness.</p>

<p>"Jane," Mrs. Hubbard said, stopping suddenly
and looking into the bright grate in front of
the stove, "shall I tell you what this puts me
in mind of, seeing this nice bright cooking-stove?
Of that New Year's night, the winter
Robert was sick, and our children were all little,
when you came round and brought them
over to spend the afternoon, and boiled candy
for them and let them pop corn. They brought
us home a plateful of braided sticks. Poor little
things! if it hadn't been for you, they wouldn't
have had so much as a pin for a New Year's
present, their father was so sick, and I was so
worn out. Why, only think, they had been
teazing me to buy them some candy, and I
actually did not feel that I could afford that
quart of molasses! I've thought of it often and
often since. Somehow, this winter there's
scarcely a day when it doesn't come into my
mind, and I always feel like crying."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snelling was crying, as Mrs. Hubbard's
voice faltered more and more; she did not attempt
to conceal it, she remembered that New
Year's day so well, and how she had pitied Susan's
poor little boys, and brought them home
and made them as happy as children could be
made, in the very kindness of her warm heart.
The long struggle with poverty and care had
not seared it, after all.</p>

<p>"Don't cry, Jane. But you won't mind, and
you won't misunderstand me now, if I've
brought you a New Year's present of a dress?
I was afraid you wouldn't take it as it was
meant, if I just sent it. Here it is." And Mrs.
Hubbard unrolled the very raw silk plaid Mrs.
Snelling had so long coveted. "I wanted it to
be useful, and I went down to get a cashmere
like mine; but you happened to be there when
I went in, and I saw how long you looked at
this."</p>

<p>Mrs. Snelling remembered the day, and that
she had come home thinking Mrs. Hubbard had
felt too grand to talk to her before the clerks.</p>

<p>"I was afraid you would find me out, and so
I kept at the other end of the store. Now, you
won't misunderstand me, will you, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Susan, I had such hard thoughts, you
don't know." And Mrs. Snelling put her apron
up to her eyes, instead of looking at the new silk.</p>

<p>"Never mind that now, it's only natural. I
could see just how you felt, for the more I tried
to be neighborly, the colder you got. It's grieved
me a good deal. But about the dress. Ann
was not very busy, and so I had her make the
skirt, as we could wear each other's dresses in
old times, and every little helps when a person
has a good deal to do. If you will let me know
when Miss Prime comes to make it up, she shall
come over and sew with her."</p>

<p>"Charity is not easily provoked, suffereth
long, and is kind," was the minister's text the
next Sunday; but Mrs. Snelling thought of a
better illustration than any he could offer, and
noted the rest of the verse with humiliation&mdash;<em>charity
envieth not</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ECONOMICS_OF_CLOTHING_AND_DRESS" id="THE_ECONOMICS_OF_CLOTHING_AND_DRESS"></a>THE ECONOMICS OF CLOTHING AND DRESS.</h2>

<p class="p6">REMAKING AND MENDING.</p>


<p>S<span class="smcapa">HAKSPEARE</span> tells us that "an old cloak
makes a new jerkin;" and with such authority
and sanction for turning old materials to new
purposes, we will make no apology for giving
our readers a chapter of advice and instruction
on some of the most feasible plans of turning old
garments to good account.</p>

<p>Many are obliged by necessity, or as a matter
of good economy, to do this; and those who are
richer, and can afford frequently to purchase
everything new for themselves, will greatly add
to their kindness to their poorer neighbors, if,
when they give a cast-off garment, it is accompanied
by a little judicious instruction as to how
to make the best of it.</p>

<p>We will suppose a poor woman receiving the
gift of a lady's dress fully trimmed all over, and
so near a fit, that she might think it had been
made on purpose for her, if it was not a little
too tight. Would it be the wisest thing she
could do to take and wear the dress just as she
received it? If she did so, the probability is
that she would do those about her, as well as
herself and her dress, a great injury. She would,
most likely, be very cross in her family, for that
is often one of the ill effects of dressing too tight.
She might, too, begin to think that she looked
so like a lady with this full-trimmed dress, that
sundry unbecoming airs would be likely to creep
over her. And as to the dress, nature would
endeavor to free itself from restraint, and hooks
and eyes would be bursting this way and that,
and the flounces, that were very suitable to a
lady's mode of life, would soon be torn and
soiled in the household occupations of a poor
woman. And in two or three weeks, this dress,
that might have been made to do her good service
for months, will have such a slovenly and
torn appearance, that it had better be put out of
sight.</p>

<p>We should recommend, as a preferable course,
that, on receiving such a gift, all conspicuous and
needless trimmings be taken off, and the body
and sleeves be made a comfortable fit, by putting
in pieces where they are needed; for which purpose
some of the trimmings will be useful. Or,
if it should be a very full skirt, it might be better
to take a breadth from that, which will serve
to make a fresh body. If it is too long, or if it
is rubbed, and a little worn at the gathers, the
skirt should be taken from the body, and sewed
on again at the right length, at the same time
placing the middle of a different breadth to the
middle of the body, so as to put the worst worn
part of the gathers to the place where they will
have the least wear. This will oblige running
up the opening at the back of the skirt, and
making a new one. All this trouble will, however,
be well repaid by having a comfortable
and suitable dress; and ladies are much more
likely to repeat a kindness when they see that
their gifts are well used and valued.</p>

<p>When a mother has worn a dress as long as
she can, it will be strange if there is not enough
which is pretty good left in the skirt, which will
make a frock, or perhaps even two, for a little
girl. It is well to bear this in mind in buying a
dress, and to choose one of a pattern that would
not be very conspicuous or unsightly if it should
afterwards be used for children.</p>

<p>Another good use to which to put an old
dress is, by altering the body and sleeves, to
adapt it for a petticoat. It is well, however,
not to be in a hurry to do this. Two mothers
had each a good black satin dress; in the course
of time they became, as unfortunately all dresses
will, too shabby, or too old-fashioned for their
wearers' use. One mother picked hers to pieces,
washed and ironed it, and made from it two
handsome-looking mantles for her daughters.
The other adapted hers for a petticoat, and spent
five dollars in the purchase of new mantles for
her two daughters. The mantles made of the
old material were far the better looking, and the
more serviceable. Now one dollar would have
bought a petticoat; and thus the saving of four
dollars might have been made for the pocket of
the husband.</p>

<p>Bonnets may be lined or made from the cuttings
of old silk dresses. A lady benevolently
disposed can find the means of assisting a needlewoman
in want of work, by employing her to
use up odd pieces in this manner. She will
thereby give the workwoman the means of earning
a few shillings, and at the same time she
will, at a comparatively little cost, enable herself
to rejoice the hearts of various old women
by the gift of a comfortable silk bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining parts of some dresses will prove
suitable for making aprons and pinafores.</p>

<p>But what can be done with dresses that are so
washed and worn as to be of no service even for
a child's frock or pinafore? Why, they may be
cut up for dusters, if they will do for nothing
else, and they will serve nicely for the little
girls to learn hemming upon. Indeed, it only
wants an active, notionable mind to discover
good uses for almost anything that may be at
hand, and render it applicable to some of the
requirements of the possessor.</p>

<p>About the worst thing to do with old dresses
is to carry them to an old clothes-shop, or to
dispose of them at the door for something out
of a basket.</p>

<p>Woollen garments, such as coats and trowsers,
offer rather more of a puzzle as to how to dispose
of them. They are, however, articles to be
by no means despised, as a peep into the working-rooms
of some old clothes establishment
might soon convince our readers. Many a
second-hand waistcoat, cap, and even child's
complete suit, have been contrived from the
refuse contents of an old clo'-man's bag. These
old clothes-merchants, however, never cut up
garments that can by any contrivance of piecing
and cleaning be made suitable for wear, or to
fetch a price in their original form. This a good
home manager should also observe.</p>

<p>Cheap bought slop-clothes are scarcely worth
the time and trouble of remaking into anything.
But a bit of broadcloth that has been originally
good may be brought into use over and over
again, when its original purpose has been almost
forgotten.</p>

<p>In a family of restricted means, where the
father is obliged, by his line of life or connections
to keep up what is called a respectable
or genteel appearance, if the mother is a good
contriver very little need be purchased for the
clothing of her boys until they reach their
teens. The clothes that the father is, for the
sake of appearance, obliged to lay aside, will
afford good material for clothing them. But
how often pride, more than a want of knowledge,
comes in here, and prevents the mother from
doing what she might and could do. She is
afraid that if she herself makes clothes for her
boys, she may be laughed at as "a hen tailor."
And if she should employ a needlewoman, who
could do such things well and inexpensively for
her, she is afraid the woman will speak of it,
and think her mean for using old clothes; and
she will in preference buy cheap, ready-made
clothes, which will not last so long, and perhaps
not look any better than what she might have
obtained for a tithe of the cost by using the
materials laid by at home.</p>

<p>To keep up a genteel appearance with only a
small income, is a very trying situation to be
placed in; nevertheless, it is the lot of very
many; and a wise woman will feel sure that she
is not acting meanly, while she acts in accordance
with the limits of her husband's purse.
Nothing can be more mean than to increase his
anxieties by indulging in any needless expenses
in dress.</p>

<p>When it is designed to make any cloth garment
into a smaller one, it is generally best to
look upon it merely as a piece of material, and
not to attempt to bring any of the old seams
into use. If it has been previously worn in the
same family, and not much soiled, a good dry
brushing may be all that is required for cleanliness.
But if it has been long worn and made
dirty, it had better be picked to pieces and
thoroughly washed. Good broadcloth will bear
washing just as well as a bit of calico; and so
will very many other articles that are frequently
considered unwashable.</p>

<p>Supposing the garment unpicked and brushed,
or washed, it should be well examined as to the
thicker and thinner parts, and the smaller pattern
laid on and cut accordingly, always observing
to keep the nap of the cloth all one way,
from the top to the bottom of the garment.
Much of the secret of the neat appearance of
clothes made by tailors is in their flatly placing
and pressing down all their seams by means of
heated irons. The seams should be opened out&mdash;that
is, each side of the seam should be folded
back, and damped and smoothed by a hot iron
before the lining is put in. As to a pattern, the
best way to obtain one is from a tailor; and
great assistance in the making up may be obtained
by observing how the article picked to
pieces was made. All visible button-holes
should be made with silk, and not thread; and a
strip for strengthening laid where buttons and
button-holes are to be. There is no reason why
clothes of this description, made by women,
should either be bad fitting, or the work clumsy
looking. This is not always the case; and any
woman who has learned the use of her needle,
and uses her powers of observation, might as
well rival the tailor as not.</p>

<p>Odd cuttings of cloth are serviceable for
mending or remaking the tops of boots. Foot-stools
also may be covered with remaining pieces,
and if braided with a lively-colored braid, have
a neat and ornamental appearance. We have
also seen made from the tails of a coat, a work-bag,
which had a pattern with colored wools
worked on each side, and really had a handsome
appearance. Girls in a family might just as
well use such materials to exercise their fancy
and ingenuity upon, and so often save a good
many wasted shillings.</p>

<p>Hearth-rugs are sometimes made by cutting
cloth into strips half an inch wide and two
inches long, and knitting them together with
string. This is done by inserting the piece of
cloth exactly at the middle, in the loop of the
knitting and drawing it in very tight; it is rather
hard finger-work, and some make the rug
by sewing the strips of cloth on to a piece of old
carpet or any other strong material that may be
at hand. This sort of rug will in winter form a
very comfortable addition to a poor man's fire-place.
Or the bits may be knitted into smaller
pieces for door-mats.</p>

<p>But when all the best bits have been employed
as use or fancy may dictate, there will still remain
some rough or thin cuttings which cannot
be worked up any how; what is to be done
with these? Perhaps we could not easily have
answered this question, had we not recently
heard a girl say, "Oh, mother is very glad indeed
of such pieces; when she gets any, she
washes them thoroughly, and sets us children
to cut them up very small indeed, and fills a case
with them to make a pillow; all our pillows and
bolsters, and even the beds at home, are made
like that, and we find them very comfortable;
mother could never afford to buy proper beds
for all us children."</p>

<p>Linen and cotton, and even flannel under-clothing,
may generally be darned and pieced
until the whole fabric is too much worn to be
worth making into garments of any other form.
It may sometimes be worth while, where the
material has been originally good, to slightly
make from them shirts and petticoats for infants;
as the growth of the infant forbids their being
worn any great length of time, and the material
having been previously used is softer than new.</p>

<h3>MAY-DAY.</h3>

<p>The observance of May-day was a custom
which, until the close of the reign of James the
First, alike attracted the attention of the royal
and the noble, as of the vulgar class. Henry
the Eighth, Elizabeth, and James patronized
and partook of its ceremonies; and, during this
extended era, there was scarcely a village in the
kingdom but had a May-pole, with its appropriate
games and dances.</p>

<p>The origin of these festivities has been attributed
to three different sources&mdash;Classic, Celtic,
and Gothic. The first appears to us to establish
the best claim to the parentage of our May-day
rites, as a relic of the Roman Floralia, which
were celebrated on the last four days of April,
and on the first of May, in honor of the goddess
Flora, and were accompanied with dancing,
music, the wearing of garlands, strewing of
flowers, &amp;c. The Bettein, or rural sacrifice of
the Highlanders, on this day, as described by
Mr. Pennant and Dr. Jamieson, seems to have
arisen from a different motive, and to have been
instituted for the purpose of propitiating the
various noxious animals which might injure or
destroy their flocks and birds. The Gothic
anniversary on May-day makes a nearer approach
to the general purpose of the Floralia,
and was intended as a thanksgiving to the sun;
if not for the return of flowers, fruit, and grain,
yet for the introduction of a better season for
fishing and hunting. The modes of conducting
the ceremonies and rejoicings on May-day may
be best drawn from the writers of the Elizabethan
period, in which this festival appears to
have maintained a very high degree of celebrity,
though not accompanied with that splendor of
exhibition which took place at an earlier period,
in the reign of Henry the Eighth. It may be
traced, indeed, from the era of Chaucer, who, in
the conclusion of his "Court of Love," has
described the feast of May, when</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Forth goth all the court, both most and leas,</div>
  <div class="i0">To fetch the floures fresh, and braunch and blome;</div>
  <div class="i0">And namely hauthorn brought both page and grome:</div>
  <div class="i0">And then, rejoysen in their great delite,</div>
  <div class="i0">Eke ech at other throw the floures bright,</div>
  <div class="i0">The primerose, the violets, and the gold,</div>
  <div class="i0">With fresh garlants party blew and white.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it should be observed that this, the simplest
mode of celebrating May-day, was as much in
vogue in the days of Shakspeare as the more
complex one, accompanied by the morris-dance
and games of Robin Hood. The following description,
by Bourne and Borlase, manifestly
alludes to the costume of this age, and to the
simpler mode of commemorating the first of
May: "On the calends, or the first day of
May," says the former, "the juvenile part of
both sexes were wont to rise a little after midnight,
and walk to some neighboring wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
accompanied with music and the blowing of horns,
where they break down branches from the trees,
and adorn them with nosegays and crowns of
flowers. When this is done, they return with
their booty homewards, about the rising of the
sun, and make their doors and windows to triumph
in the flowery spoil. The after part of
the day is chiefly spent in dancing round a tall
pole, which is called a May-pole; which, being
placed in a convenient part of the village, stands
there, as it were, consecrated to the goddess of
flowers, without the least violence offered to it,
in the whole circle of the year."</p>

<p>"An ancient custom," says the latter, "still
retained by the Cornish, is that of decking their
doors and porches on the first of May with green
sycamore and hawthorn boughs, and of planting
trees, or rather stumps of trees, before their
houses. And, on May-eve, they from towns
make excursions into the country, and, having
cut down a tall elm, brought it into town, fitted
a straight and taper pole to the end of it, and
painted the same, erect it in the most public
places; and on holidays and festivals adorn it
with flower-garlands, or ensigns and streamers."
So generally prevalent was this habit of early
rising on May-day, that Shakspeare makes one
of his inferior characters in King Henry the
Eighth exclaim&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Pray, sir, be patient; 'tis as much impossible</div>
  <div class="i0">(Unless we sweep them from the door with cannons)</div>
  <div class="i0">To scatter them, as 'tis to make them sleep</div>
  <div class="i0">On May-day morning; which will never be.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, about the commencement of the sixteenth
century, or sooner, a very material addition was
made to the celebration of the rites of May-day
by the introduction of the characters of Robin
Hood and some of his associates. This was done
with a view towards the encouragement of
archery, and the custom was continued even
beyond the close of the reign of James the First.
It is true that the May-games, in their rudest
form&mdash;the mere dance of lads and lasses round a
May-pole, or the simple morris with the Lady of
the May&mdash;were occasionally seen during the
days of Elizabeth; but the general exhibition
was the more complicated ceremony which we
are about to describe. The personages who now
become the chief performers in the morris-dance
were four of the most popular outlaws of Sherwood
Forest. Warner, the contemporary of
Shakspeare, speaking of the periods of some of
our festivals, and remarking that "ere Penticost
began our May," adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Tho' (then) Robin Hood, litell John, frier Tuck,</div>
  <div class="i1">And Marian, deftly play,</div>
  <div class="i0">And lord and ladie gang till kirke,</div>
  <div class="i1">With lads and lasses gay;</div>
  <div class="i0">Fra masse and een sang sa gud cheere,</div>
  <div class="i1">And glee on ery greene.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These four characters, therefore&mdash;Robin Hood,
Little John, Friar Tuck, and Maid Marian&mdash;although
no constituent parts of the original
English morris, became at length so blended
with it, especially on the festival of May-day,
that, until the practice of archery was nearly laid
aside, they continued to be the most essential
part of the pageantry.</p>

<h2>BLESSINGTON'S CHOICE.</h2>

<p class="p6">BY FITZ MORNER.</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Be kind to thy mother, for lo, on her brow,</div>
  <div class="i1">May traces of sorrow be seen."&mdash;<em>Popular Melody.</em></div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, Blessington, so you've come back to
locate with us, have you? Got enough of travelling
and all its vexations, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Enough? As you please about that, George;
but I find no vexations so weighty as to overcome
the pleasures to be enjoyed in travel, by
any manner of means. Still, I have returned to
settle down in my native land, and my good
genius seems to have thrown Dallydale in my
way; so here I remain, and have commenced
practice, as you see&mdash;or, rather, <em>intend</em> to commence,
when any business presents itself."</p>

<p>"Excuse impertinence, Harry," said the first
speaker, with a roguish look, "but&mdash;you'll get
a wife, I suppose? You know, that's an absolute
necessity in these days; to say nothing
about performing an act of kindness to the scores
who are waiting but to be asked."</p>

<p>"Well, I am not so certain as to the truth of
that last remark; nevertheless, I <em>have</em> some intentions
of that nature. By the way, George,
can't you introduce me to some of the Dallydale
ladies, that I may find a maiden to my liking?
You know, I'm a perfect stranger in these
parts."</p>

<p>"Good!" said George, springing from his
chair, and thrusting his thumbs in the arm-holes
of his waistcoat. "'Pon honor, I should be delighted
to introduce you to some of my lady acquaintance.
Ahem! 'Miss Jones, my friend,
Mr. Blessington, of&mdash;of'&mdash;where shall it be,
Harry? Paris, or London, or New York, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
where? By my troth, Harry, you're the only
mortal that I'd give a fig to exchange situations
with; but you, with your fortune, your magnificent
figure, your"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There! there, George; I declare, I was in
hopes you had discarded those old ways of yours.
It's exceedingly disagreeable, if you knew it, to
be descanted upon in this manner to one's face.
But come, when for those introductions?"</p>

<p>"This very night, Harry, if you please. I'll
go with you, and call on some of my host of
familiar acquaintances. By the way, there's one
young lady, Miss Somers, a cousin of mine, who
saw you at church last Sabbath, and who wishes
to make your acquaintance. And&mdash;would you
believe it?&mdash;she even told me so slyly. Yet
there's no great wonder; for a man of your
magnificent build"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But Blessington closed his lips by placing his
finger upon them, and together they left the
office and disappeared up the street. These two
young men were old schoolmates, and were quite
familiar in their manner with each other.
Blessington had been travelling in different
lands for a couple of years previous, and, on his
return to the United States, had fallen in with
his friend, George Hart, some years his junior,
and withal a pretty wild, though whole-hearted
fellow. Both were wealthy, both of very prepossessing
appearance and manners; but Blessington,
if either, the more so.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day in which we
introduce them to you, kind reader, they sallied
out as they had agreed. We cannot detail their
pleasant evening's ramble; suffice it to say that
Blessington was convinced that Dallydale was
possessed of as charming ladies, and as kind
and hospitable souls, as many other places of
greater note. The Miss Somers of whom Hart
had spoken, Blessington found to be a lady possessed
of dazzling beauty, and a power of conversation
he had seldom seen excelled. Accomplished,
elegant, and lovely, it may appear
strange to you, reader, when we tell you that
our hero was not at all prepossessed by her appearance.
He saw, or thought he saw, a species
of contemptuous pride, a sort of glorying in her
own attractions, and a scorning of all "lesser
lights," that, to a man of his generous disposition,
was anything but pleasing.</p>

<p>At another place, however, he saw a lady who
was introduced to him as Miss Ella Cole, who
appeared possessed of all those good qualities of
the heart for which he sought. And, indeed,
what beauty there was in her expressive features
owed its existence to the genuine artlessness,
affection, and sincerity shadowed forth in
each particular lineament. Hart was not slow
to observe that Blessington appeared inclined
more strongly to "tarry yet a little" at this place
than at any other during the entire evening.</p>

<p>That night Blessington had a dream, in which
a certain pair of mild blue eyes, light sunny
ringlets, and <em>petite</em> figure bore no insignificant
part. There was another, too, whose ruby lips
seemed to curl contemptuously towards the
meek one, and whose piercing black eyes seemed
to flash upon her the fires of hatred.</p>

<p>Some days after, Blessington met Miss Somers
at the mansion of Colonel Auberly, and she appeared
delighted to see him. Blessington, in the
nobleness of his heart, was equally pleased at
meeting her; and thus was the finishing stroke
put to the work that rent from Miss Somers her
proud heart and placed it in Blessington's possession,
he all unconscious of the precious treasure
he had obtained, and with his own safe in
the place that God ordained for it.</p>

<p>Oh, ye that speak of the folly of prating of
woman's wiles, know ye that when she determines,
with her whole soul, to win a man's
heart, it is twenty to one that, in spite of all human
obstacles, she will accomplish her purpose?
This was the spirit now awakened in Miss Somers's
proud bosom. She saw, with her apt intelligence,
the state of Blessington's feelings
with regard to her, and she resolved that, come
what would, she would obtain from our hero
that which alone could content her ambitious
soul&mdash;his unbounded affections. Did she succeed?
You shall see.</p>

<p>From that hour forth, a change was noticed
in the entire deportment of Flora Somers, and
many were the conjectures as to what might be
the cause thereof; but all were equally distant
from the truth. Her haughty bearing in society
had yielded to one of apparent humility, kindness,
and a desire to gratify those around her.
Blessington noticed it, and, far from supposing
the real truth, he concluded that such was her
natural disposition, and that his first impressions
were the result of some unaccountable
state of his mind at the time of his introduction
to her.</p>

<p>However this might be, it was observed that
his visits at Dr. Somers's were of frequent occurrence,
and soon every gossip of Dallydale
had another match in her eye. Few doubted
that Flora Somers would eventually be Mrs.
Blessington. And if our hero had been interrogated
upon the subject, his replies&mdash;if he gave
any&mdash;would not have been greatly at variance
with this belief.</p>

<p>Might a peep have been taken behind the parlor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
curtains of Dr. Somers's mansion, on the
occasion of some of these calls, one might have
seen how</p>

<p>
"Soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake again."<br />
</p>

<p>Thus matters stood. You who have passed
the ordeal of love, and are now roaming in the
fair fields of Hymen, can imagine what were
Blessington's intentions and Flora Somers's expectations;
while you who, like myself, have
only read of such things, must content yourselves
with the testimony of the initiated. Thus
matters stood.</p>

<p>One evening, Blessington had sallied out for
the evening rather earlier than was his wont,
and was on his way to Dr. Somers's, intending
to at once make known his intentions to "the
most adorable of her sex," and be consigned to
"everlasting misery or the supremacy of bliss,"
as she should decide.</p>

<p>Ha reached the door, and had laid his hand
on the bell-knob, when he heard a voice sharply
enunciating words which struck a chill to his
heart's core, but whose pronouncer's voice
sounded terribly like that of Miss Somers. He
paused and listened.</p>

<p>"Well, mind your own business!" was the
sound that greeted his ear from within, in a
voice which there was now no mistaking.</p>

<p>"Flora!" reproachfully murmured the gentle
voice of Mrs. Somers. And then followed the
doctor with&mdash;</p>

<p>"My daughter, are you never to desist from
your unfeeling disregard of a mother's love?
Are you never to repay, even by respect and
kindness, that anxiety and devotion with which
she watched over your earlier years? It wounds
me deeply that a daughter of mine should persist
in thus treating one who loves her as no
other being on earth ever can. Go to your
room, Flora, and remain until you will ask your
mother's forgiveness."</p>

<p>The hall-door was then closed with a bang,
and Blessington heard the light foot of his heart's
beloved ascending the stairway. He tarried no
longer, but turned away and retraced his steps
to his office. Locking the door behind him, he
threw himself into a chair, and, from the bitter
emotions of his soul, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"My God, what have I heard! Can it be
that my own dear Flora is possessed of a heart
like this? Though it tear the cords of my soul
in shreds, I never will take to my bosom one
who can thus treat her mother. Spirit of my
sainted mother, idol of all my early dreams,
never will I forsake the vow I plighted o'er thy
corpse!"</p>

<p>Bowing his head upon his hands, Blessington
became lost in the memories of the past. Hallowed
associations arose to his view, and passed
in solemn retrospect over his mind. He thought
of his boyhood's days, of the old stone mansion
that stood in the leafy grove, of the happy hours
he had spent in those ancient halls, and he murmured
a prayer to heaven, thanking his Maker
for thus revealing to him the yawning abyss of
misery into which he had been about to plunge.</p>

<p>After this came a calmness and capacity for
deliberation that ere long recalled to his mind
the recollection of Ella Cole&mdash;she that months
since had appeared so attractive to him. As it
was yet early, he sallied out, and a few minutes'
walk found him at the door of the humble brick
dwelling at the foot of the main street in the
village, where Mr. Cole had long lived and pursued
his honest calling. As he was about to
ring, his hand was again arrested by the sound
of a female voice; not in a loud tone, but softly,
lowly, like the murmuring of distant music. It
was Ella Cole reading from the "Lady's Book"
a tale to her mother, who was listening with
earnest attention.</p>

<p>"Ella, my dear girl," called a manly voice
from an adjoining room, "will you please to
bring me the last number of the 'Living Age?'
It lies on the parlor table."</p>

<p>"Yes, father," said Ella, springing up. "Excuse
me a moment, mother."</p>

<p>"Be quick, dear," was the mother's reply.</p>

<p>Light footsteps were heard tripping over the
floor, and soon again was heard the voice of the
sweet girl reading to her mother. Blessington
could not resist comparing this scene with that
of an hour previous. Being reluctant to intrude
upon so happy a scene, he again retired and
sought his office, but with far different feelings
from those of a short time before.</p>

<p>He called next evening, and was more than
ever convinced of the good qualities of Ella
Cole's heart. She remained Ella Cole not long
thereafter. She now rejoices in the name of
Blessington, and proves a source of unceasing
happiness to her worthy husband. Many wondered
at this marriage&mdash;none more so than the
two ladies most intimately concerned.</p>

<p>You have perused the simple truth, reader,
related to the writer by him we have called
George Hart. Blessington is not the only one
in the human family who regards a mother in
the light nearest approaching that of an angel
of any other mortal, nor the only one that
knows that in the degree which a girl is a good
<em>daughter</em>, in the same degree will she be a good
<em>wife</em>.</p>

<h2>NEW REVELATIONS OF AN OLD COUNTRY.</h2>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe40"  src="images/i_427.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE GRAND LAMA.</div>
</div>


<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> are growing wiser in our generation. Two
propositions we have fully demonstrated, viz.,
that some things can be done as well as others,
and that some people know as much as others.
The latter proposition is confirmed by the developments
of each succeeding day. For a considerable
period, we were contentedly wrapt up
in the belief which the old Grecians took unto
themselves. We were assured that all the enlightenment
which had been vouchsafed to this
sublunary sphere dwelt with us, and that all beyond
our narrow circle was shrouded in the
gloom of ignorance and barbarism. We were
the chosen people. Travellers have worked remarkable
changes in that flattering faith.</p>

<p>Much has been written concerning Tartary,
Thibet, and China. But, upon reflection, we
shall ascertain that our real knowledge of those
countries, which form so large a portion of the
globe, is exceedingly limited. We confidently
receive and spread abroad the grossest errors in
regard to the nature of these regions, the character
of the inhabitants, and the peculiarities
of their institutions. These errors may now receive
due correction, for which we have to thank
two adventurous French missionaries, of the
Catholic Church, MM. Gabet and Huc. About
the year 1844, the Pope established an Apostolical
Vicariat of Mongolia; and, it being deemed
expedient to ascertain the nature and extent of
the diocese thus created, MM. Gabet and Huc,
two Lazarists who were then attached to the
petty mission of Si-Wang, were deputed to obtain
the necessary intelligence. Through incredible
difficulties they made their way to Lha-Ssa,
the capital of Thibet and chief seat of Lamanism.
Soon afterwards, Ke-Shen, the famous
Chinese minister, had them arrested for political
reasons, and deported to China, whence they
were allowed to proceed to France. These missionaries
enjoyed the best opportunities for observing
the character of the inhabitants and the
nature of the institutions in the countries they
visited, and their statements may be relied upon
as truth.</p>

<p>Tartary and Thibet are dependencies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
Chinese empire. The former is a vast region,
divided into Mongolia, Mantchouria, and Elé.
Mongolia comprises the territory lying between
35° and 50° north latitude, and 82° and 123°
east longitude. Its length from east to west is
about 1,700 miles, and its breadth about 1,000
miles. The surface of the country may be described
as an elevated plateau, inclosed to the
north-west by the Altai chain, and on the south
by the Thibetian ranges. In the centre is the
great sandy desert of Gobi, or Shamo, which is
for the most part destitute of water and vegetation.
Rivers are numerous north of the desert,
and south of it are to be found several beautiful
lakes. The climate is excessively cold, owing
to the great elevation, dry atmosphere, and want
of shelter from the winds, and the soil is almost
entirely barren. As might be expected from the
nature of the country, the Mongols are nomadic,
wandering within certain limits with their herds
and flocks. They pass the greater part of their
waking hours on horseback, or on their camels,
where they sometimes sleep. They are hardy
and active, and have always been famed for their
warlike disposition. Under the great Timour,
they subdued the largest portion of Asia. But
their power is now confined to their own barren
territory. Their religion is called Lamanism,
and the Lamas are at once their rulers, priests,
and teachers. The tribes of that portion of
Mongolia called Koukou-Noor have princely
chiefs, who are tributary to the Emperor of
China.</p>

<p>Mantchouria comprises the most eastern portion
of the elevated plateau of Central Asia, and
lies between 42° and 58° north latitude, and
120° and 140° east longitude. It has the Yablonnoi
mountains on the north, the Chinese
seas on the east and south, and the Sialkoi
mountains on the west. The greater part of the
country is covered with forests, in which bears,
tigers, wolves, deer, and numerous fur-bearing
animals abound. This region is well watered.
Besides several lakes of considerable size, it has
the great River Amour, or Saghalien, which is
about 2,200 miles in length. Mantchouria is
inhabited by a number of roving tribes; but the
principal are those called Mantchoos. They
differ but slightly from the other inhabitants of
Tartary, and may be spoken of in connection
with them.</p>

<p>Elé is an extensive region east of the Celestial
Mountains, stretching from 36° to 49° north
latitude, and from 71° to 96° east longitude.
Soorgaria occupies about one-third of the province.
This territory is the penal colony of the
Chinese empire. Large bodies of convicts are
sent here to work, and guarded by Chinese
troops. The country is wild, and but a small
portion of it is under cultivation.</p>

<p>Thibet is the most southern of the three great
table-lands of Central Asia. It is surrounded
by lofty mountains, most of which are extremely
difficult of ascent. It has Gobi and Khoten on
the north, Kokonor on the north-east, Szechuen
and Yunan, provinces of China proper, on the
east, and provinces of India upon the south and
west. The average length of this great plateau
is about fourteen hundred miles, and the average
breadth about three hundred miles. The highest
plains are at least ten thousand feet above
the sea. Thibet is divided by mountain ranges
into three distinct parts. The western one consists
of the valley of the Indus. The central
one comprises an extensive desert land. The
eastern consists of a number of ridges and
peaks. The number of peaks above the line of
perpetual snow is greater than in any other part
of the world. The Indus, Yang-tse-kiang, and
the Brahmaputra, three of the largest rivers in
the world, have their primary sources in Thibet.
The lakes are large, and some of the isolated
ones are perfectly salt. The climate is
pure and excessively dry. The soil is better
adapted for grazing than for cultivation; but
the plain in which Lha-Ssa, the capital, is situated,
is remarkably fertile. The Thibetians belong
to the Mongolian race, and their general
character resembles that of the Tartars of Central
and Northern Asia.</p>

<p>We have said that the grossest errors are entertained
in regard to the customs and institutions
of the Tartars and Thibetians. These we
are now enabled to correct by the revelations of
MM. Gabet and Huc, and we begin with their
religion, for by that their customs and institutions
are shaped, in a great degree.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that Lamanism, or reformed
Buddhism, which is the religion of about
one hundred and seventy millions of people inhabiting
Tartary, Thibet, and China proper, is a
species of degrading idolatry, on a level with the
dark heathenism of the Hindoo&mdash;brutal, sensual,
and deserving of the contempt of enlightened
Christian minds. An account of the origin and
nature of this religion will show how far we
have been from the truth.</p>

<p>According to the Lamanesque chronicles, a
shepherd named Lombo-Moke, of the country
called Amdo, in Tartary, married a woman
named Ching-tsa-Tsio, who shared with him the
cares of a pastoral life. In the year of the Fire
Hen (1357) Ching-tsa-Tsio had a child, whose
birth was attended with many miraculous features,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
according to the traditions of the people
among whom his mission was to be performed.
The child was a marvellous being. At his birth
he had a white beard, and his countenance expressed
an extraordinary majesty. As soon as
he saw the light, he was capable of expressing
himself with clearness and precision in the language
of Amdo. At the age of three, Tsong-Kaba
resolved to embrace a religious life. Ching-tsa-Tsio
herself shaved his head, and threw his
fine hair outside of the tent. From this hair
sprung a tree, the wood of which dispensed an
exquisite perfume around, and each leaf of
which bore upon its surface a character in the
sacred language of Thibet. Tsong-Kaba withdrew
into most absolute retirement, and passed
his days in fasting and prayer upon the summits
of the highest mountains. He respected the life
of even the humblest insect, and rigorously interdicted
himself the consumption of any flesh
whatever. While he was thus engaged in purifying
his heart, a Lama, from one of the most
remote regions of the west, visited Amdo, and
amazed the people by his learning and the sanctity
of his life. His appearance was remarked
as singular. He had a great nose, and his
eye gleamed with something like seraphic fire.
Tsong-Kaba sought him for an instructor, and
he, struck with the wonderful qualities of the
young man, took him for a disciple. After having
initiated his pupil in all the doctrines recognized
by the most renowned saints of the west,
the stranger fell asleep one day on the summit
of a mountain, and never opened his eyes on
earth again.</p>

<p>Deprived of his tutor, Tsong-Kaba determined
to proceed westward, and drink the precepts of
sacred science where that tutor had quaffed
them. He reached the sacred town of Central
Thibet; and there a <em>Lla</em>, or spirit, all radiant
with light, checked his progress, and thus addressed
him: "Oh, Tsong-Kaba, all these vast
regions belong to the great empire which has
been granted to thee. It is here thou art ordained
to promulgate the rites of religion and its
prayers. It is here will be accomplished the
last evolution of thy immortal life." Tsong-Kaba
then entered Lha-Ssa, the Land of Spirits,
and began his career as a teacher and reformer.</p>

<p>The ancient worship of Buddha was strongly
rooted in the minds of the people. But Tsong-Kaba
made partisans rapidly. They were called
Yellow Cap Lamas, to distinguish them from
the Red Cap Lamas who supported the old system.
In a short time, the reformers became
predominant, and the homage of the multitude
was turned from the living Buddha, or Chakdja,
the head of the old hierarchy, to Tsong-Kaba.
At an interview between the two chiefs, a discussion
was held, which resulted in the complete
triumph of the reformer. Thenceforward the
reforms proposed met with no obstacle; they
were adopted throughout Thibet and Tartary.
In 1419, the soul of Tsong-Kaba, who had become
Buddha, quitted the earth, returned to the
Celestial Realm, and was admitted to the heaven
of rapture. His body is reported to preserve all
its freshness to the present day; and, by a
perennial miracle, it lies a little above the earth,
without being supported by anything visible.
Besides reforming the liturgy, Tsong-Kaba issued
a new edition of the "Body of Doctrine," and
left, among his other works, an important one
entitled the "Lam-Rim-Tsien-Bo, or the Progressive
Path to Perfection."</p>

<p>MM. Gabet and Huc were impressed with the
striking similarity between the Lamanesque
worship and Catholicism. The cross, the mitre,
the dalmatica, the cape, which the Grand Lamas
wear on their journeys, or when they are
performing some ceremony out of the temple;
the service with double choirs, the psalmody,
the exorcisms, the censer, suspended from five
chains; the benedictions given by the Lamas by
extending the right hand over the head of the
faithful; the chaplet, ecclesiastical celibacy,
spiritual retirement, the worship of the saints,
the fasts, the processions, the litanies, the holy
water, all these are analogous in the two modes
of worship. Monasteries were founded by
Tsong-Kaba, and they now contain a very large
number of Lamas. The principal one is situated
about three leagues from Lha-Ssa. It contains
eight thousand Lamas, who devote the greater
portion of their lives to study. The monastery
of Hounboum is situated at the Lamanesque
Mecca&mdash;the foot of the mountain where Tsong-Kaba
was born. Near it is shown the tree of
the Ten Thousand Images, which is said to
have sprung from the hair of Tsong-Kaba. MM.
Gabet and Huc both saw this wonderful tree,
and they testify that Thibetian characters are
distinctly traceable upon its leaves. It is covered
by a dome of silver, erected by the Emperor
Khang-Hi.</p>

<p>The French missionaries naturally conjectured
that the Lama from the remote west, who taught
Tsong-Kaba, was a Christian priest. Upon a
further intercourse with the Thibetians, they
learned that the only two essential points in
which the Lamas of Thibet differed from the
Catholic priests of Rome, were concerning the
origin of the world and the transmigration of
souls. Two alternatives presented themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
to the minds of the missionaries: To believe
that the Thibetians had enjoyed the blessing of
a divine revelation, or that they had been visited
ages before by Christian missionaries. They
concluded the latter was the most rational and
probable. The celebrated Swedenborg declared
that an Ancient Word, a revelation prior to the
Mosaic, and including the lost Book of Jasher,
was still preserved in Tartary; and the members
of his church now assert that the discoveries
of MM. Gabet and Huc go very far towards
establishing the truth of this declaration.</p>

<p>The Lamanesque Church has a regular organization
like that of the Church of Rome. Each
Tartar kingdom has a Grand Lama, who is selected
from the members of the royal family.
There is also a Grand Lama for all Thibet.
This personage resides in the Lamasery, like a
living idol, receiving every day the adorations
of the devout, upon whom, in return, he bestows
his blessing. Everything which relates to
prayers and liturgical ceremonies is placed under
his immediate superintendence. The Mongol
Grand Lama is charged with the administration,
good order, and executive of the Lamasery; he
governs while his colleague is content to reign.
Each Lamasery of the first class has a Living
Buddha for its head. He is believed to be immortal.
When his death is reported, there is
no mourning in the Lamasery; for it is believed
that he will soon reappear as a child. The augur,
or Tchurtchur, indicates the place where
the child will declare himself, and this always
occurs. A certain precocious child announces
that he is the Living Buddha, and the people
immediately display the most enthusiastic joy.
The child is rigidly examined as to the residence,
habits, and property of the deceased Buddha.
If his answers are satisfactory, and they generally
are, he is conducted in triumph to his
Lamasery, the people prostrating themselves
along his path.</p>

<p>The Grand Lamas who govern have a number
of subalterns, who direct the details of administration.
After this staff, the inhabitants of the
Lamasery are divided into Lama-masters and
Lama-disciples, or Chabis. Each Lama has
under his direction one or more Chabis, who
live in his small house and execute all the details
of the household. These Chabis are also
considered as pupils, and when they fail to commit
their studies to memory they are severely
punished.</p>

<p>All instruction, both in Thibet and Tartary,
is ecclesiastical. It is said that the majority of
the people constantly act with a view to a future
life. They are, in fact, much more consistently
religious, according to their notions, than
the so-called Christian nations of Europe. As
to the character of those notions, we may learn
from the Thibetian work entitled "The Forty-Two
Points of Instruction delivered by Buddha,"
that they are purely moral. According to
this book, "there are in living creatures ten
species of acts which are called good, and also
ten species of acts which are called evil. There
are three which appertain to the body, murder,
theft, and impurity; four, which appertain to
speech, are words sowing discord, insulting
maledictions, impudent lies, and hypocritical
expressions; three appertaining to the will, are
envy, anger, and malignant thoughts." The
wicked man who persecutes a good man is compared
to a madman who spits against heaven,
the spittle falling back in his face. The man
who seeks riches is compared to a child who
cuts itself while trying to eat honey with a knife.
Voluptuousness is denounced as a sin, and the
dominion of the mind over the passions of the
heart is rigidly enforced. The belief in a spiritual
God, who rewards good actions and
punishes evil ones, is common to all Tartars
and Thibetians. They believe that he is the
beginning and end of all things, and that he has
assumed the human shape and appeared among
men to stimulate them to do good. They divide
living beings into six classes, angels, demons,
men, quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles, corresponding
to the six syllables of the prayer they constantly
repeat: "Om mani pad me houm."
(Oh, the gem in the lotus, Amen.) The meaning
of this singular prayer is said to be an aspiration
after divine perfection. The reward of
the just and perfect is believed to be an absorption
into the blissful soul of the Deity.</p>

<p>The monasteries of these people differ in some
respects from the Catholic establishments of
Europe. It cannot be said that the Lamas live
in community. You may find among them all
the graduated shades of poverty and wealth that
you see in mundane cities. Every third month,
the authorities make a distribution of meal to
all the Lamas of the Lamaseries without distinction.
The voluntary offerings of the pilgrims
to Hounboum come in aid of this donation.
Some of these offerings are in money;
but generally they consist of a tea-drinking entertainment,
to which all the Lamas are invited.
These entertainments are very expensive.</p>

<p>A large number of the Lamas gain a livelihood
by the ordinary occupations of life; but a
certain class devote themselves entirely to study
and contemplation. Among the industrial Lamas,
a number occupy themselves in printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
and transcribing the Lamanesque books. The
Thibetian writing proceeds horizontally from
left to right. Stereotype printing on wood is
alone practised, no use being made of movable
type. The Thibetian books resemble a large
pack of cards, the leaves being movable and
printed on both sides. The manuscript editions
of the Lamanesque books are enriched with
illustrative designs, and the characters are elegantly
traced. The Lamas use sized paper and
a bamboo pen. Their inkstand is filled with
cotton saturated with ink.</p>

<p>In each Lamasery there is a Faculty of Prayers,
and the Grand Lama and the students of
this department are often appealed to by the
government to preserve their locality from calamity.
On these occasions, the Lamas ascend
to the summits of high mountains, and spend
two whole days in praying, exorcising, and in
erecting the Pyramid of Peace&mdash;a small pyramid
of earth whitened with lime, a flag, inscribed
with Thibetian characters, floating above.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe40" src="images/i_431.jpg" width="900" height="750" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THE PYRAMID OF PEACE.</div>
</div>

<p>Each Lamasery has also a Faculty of Medicine.
The physicians assign to the human frame four
hundred and forty-four maladies. In the medical
books the symptoms are described and the
remedies stated. Bleeding and cupping are
sometimes resorted to. The books contain much
quackery, but also a large number of valuable
recipes, the benefits of which are confirmed by
long experience and observation.</p>

<p>Four great festivals are observed by the Tartars
and Thibetians during the year. The most
famous of all is the Feast of Flowers, which
takes place on the fifteenth day of the first moon.
It is celebrated with the greatest magnificence
at Hounboum, where, at the appointed time, a
vast number of pilgrims congregate. Three
months are occupied in preparation, a Council
of Fine Arts being appointed to superintend.
The most remarkable achievements are the butter-works&mdash;all
the Asiatic nations being represented
with their peculiar physiognomies and
costumes in fresh butter. MM. Gabet and Huc
state that this butter-work and the arrangement
of the flowers excelled anything they ever beheld
as the result of art. At night the exhibition
was splendidly illuminated. In front of the
principal temple there was a theatre with its
performers and decorations, all of butter. The
<em>dramatis personæ</em> were a foot high, and represented
a community of Lamas on their way to
solemnize prayer. The Lamas were movable
puppets. The day after the Feast of Flowers
not a trace remains of these splendid works.
All are demolished, and the butter thrown to
the cows.</p>

<p>The Thibetians have made extensive progress
in those arts which are generally considered the
flowers of civilization. Their architecture, though
somewhat fantastical, often appears grand. Some
of their temples are very imposing. Most of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
the houses at the capital at Lha-Ssa are several
stories high, terminating in a terrace, slightly
sloped to carry off the water. They are white-washed
all over, except the bordering round the
doors and windows, which is painted red or
yellow. The people of Lha-Ssa are in the habit
of painting their houses once a year, so that they
always seem as if just built. In one of the
suburbs, the houses are built of the horns of
oxen and sheep, and they present a most fantastical
appearance. Lha-Ssa is laid out with broad
streets, and surrounded with a beautiful wall of
gardens. Besides the taste and architectural
skill displayed in the erection of the temples
and dwelling-houses of the capital, we find a
number of grand mausoleums in various parts
of Thibet, which evince a high degree of development
in art. The Thibetians are not in
the habit of burying their dead. In general, the
bodies are left upon the summits of the mountains,
or thrown to the dogs, being esteemed but
as worthless clods; but mausoleums have been
erected in honor of famous Grand Lamas.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe40" src="images/i_432.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">THEATRE AT THE FEAST OF FLOWERS.</div>
</div>

<p>The manufactures of the Thibetians are
various and valuable. Although the severest
labor is performed by the women, the men employ
themselves quite profitably, especially in
spinning and weaving wool. The stuffs they
manufacture, which are called poulon, are of a
very close and solid fabric, and surprisingly
various in quality, from the coarsest cloths to
the finest possible merino. By a rule of reformed
Buddhism, every Lama must be attired in red
poulon. The consumption of the article in
Thibet is very large, and considerable quantities
are exported. The pastile-sticks, so celebrated
in China, are manufactured at Lha-Ssa, of various
aromatic trees, mixed with musk and gold
dust. When these sticks are lighted they consume
slowly, and diffuse around an exquisite
perfume. The Thibetians have no porcelain,
but they manufacture all kinds of pottery in
great perfection. The only tea-service used
throughout Thibet is a wooden cup, which is
either carried in the bosom or suspended from
the girdle. Some of the most costly cups have
the property of neutralizing poisons.</p>

<p>The agricultural productions of the Thibetians
are very poor. They cultivate a little wheat
and still less rice. The chief production is
tsing-kon, or black barley, of which is made
the tsamba, that basis of the aliment of the
entire Thibetian population. All the labor of
cultivating the ground is performed by the women.
The implements used are of the most
primitive description, and the work is wretchedly
done.</p>

<p>Thibet is exceedingly rich in metals. Gold
and silver are collected there so readily, that the
common shepherds have become acquainted
with the art of purifying these precious metals.
Specie is of a low value, and, consequently, goods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
maintain a high price. The monetary system
of the Thibetians consists entirely of silver
coins, which are somewhat larger than French
francs. On one side they bear an inscription,
and upon the other, they have a crown of light,
small flowers. To facilitate commerce, these
coins are cut into pieces, the number of flowers
remaining on each piece determining its value&mdash;a
very simple, yet adequate arrangement.
In the larger commercial transactions, ingots of
silver are employed. The Pebouns, or Indians
settled at Lha-Ssa, are the only workers in
metals at the capital. In their quarters, you
may find ironsmiths, braziers, plumbers, tin-men,
founders, goldsmiths, jewellers, machinists,
and even chemists. There all sorts of vases
are manufactured for the use of the Lamaseries,
and some of them are exquisitely ornamented.
While these Indians are the chief manufacturers
of Thibet, the Katchi, or Musselmen, are the
leading merchants. Their religion and their
trade are respected by the government.</p>

<p>The greater portion of the wealth of Thibet
is the property of the Lamaseries. The people
experience all the misery consequent upon the
existence of an overpaid church establishment.
Yet they are so devoted to their religion that
they are never weary of making rich offerings
to the Lamas. There are swarms of beggars
throughout the country; but it is only just to
observe that the Thibetians are kind and compassionate,
and that those who are blessed with
a goodly store give freely.</p>

<p>The condition of woman is always a fair test
of progress in civilization. Polygamy prevails,
with the sanction of the Lamanesque religion,
in Thibet and Tartary. But the first wife is
always the mistress of the household, and the
most respected in the family. MM. Gabet and
Huc thought polygamy a real blessing to the
people of those countries. Celibacy being imposed
on the Lamas, and the class of those who
shave the head and live in Lamaseries being so
numerous, it is easy to conceive what disorders
would arise from the multiplication of young
women without support, and abandoned to
themselves, if girls could not be placed in families
in the quality of second wives. Divorce is
frequent, and it takes place without any intervention
of civil or ecclesiastical authorities. In
Tartary, the women lead an independent life,
coming and going at pleasure.</p>

<p>The Thibetian women submit, in their toilet,
to a custom or law scarcely credible. Before
going out of doors they always rub their faces
over with a sort of black, glutinous varnish, the
object being to render themselves as ugly and
hideous as possible. This practice is said to be
about two hundred years old, and tradition says
that it originated with an austere Lama king,
who desired to check licentiousness of manners.
At present, the women who bedaub their faces
the most hideously are esteemed the most pious.
The women lead an active and laborious life.
Besides fulfilling the various duties of the
household, they concentrate in their own hands
all the petty trade of the country, whether as
hawkers, as stall-keepers in the streets or in the
shops. Little or no restraint is imposed upon
them. Their general character for morality is
good&mdash;in fact, if compared with that of other
Asiatic women, quite exemplary. They are
strictly attentive to their devotions, and will
even go beyond the men in deeds of penance
and mortification of the body.</p>

<p>We hope we have given a sufficient idea of
the recent revelations concerning Thibetian and
Tartarian life to awaken an interest in further
developments. The discoveries of the French
missionaries have but opened the way for others
of the highest importance to mankind. From
what we have related, it will be inferred that
the work of Christianizing Asia will not be so
difficult as has hitherto been supposed; that reformed
Buddhism is a good preparation of one
hundred and seventy millions of people for the
reception of those truths which Christians believe
to be necessary to the salvation of man;
and that we have not false idols to throw down,
but to a belief essentially pure, spiritual, and
godly, to add that definite knowledge of a new
dispensation, the universal prevalence of which
must banish strife from the face of the earth,
and render it a realm of uninterrupted bliss.</p>

<h3>REMEMBERED HAPPINESS.</h3>

<p>M<span class="smcapa">ANKIND</span> are always happier for having been
happy; so that if you make them happy now,
you make them happy twenty years hence, by
the memory of it. A childhood passed with a
due mixture of rational indulgence, under fond
and wise parents, diffuses over the whole of
life a feeling of calm pleasure, and in extreme
old age is the very last remembrance which
time can erase from the mind of man. How
enjoyment, however inconsiderable, is confined
to the present moment! A man is the happier
for life from having made once an agreeable
tour, or lived for any length of time with pleasant
people, or enjoyed any considerable interval
of innocent pleasure.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII.</h4>

<p>A <span class="smcapa">BOY</span> of more robust constitution and fuller
of blood than Henry Gaston, with that activity
which a fine flow of animal spirits and a high
degree of health give, would have cared little for
the exposure to which he was subjected at
Sharp's, even if clad no more comfortably. But
Henry had little of that healthy warmth natural
to the young. He was constitutionally delicate,
and this caused him to feel more keenly the
chilling intensity of the cold to which he was
frequently exposed without sufficient clothing.
His whole dress, intended to protect him from
the cold of a remarkably severe and trying winter,
was a thin shirt, the remains of one worn
for nearly a year; the jacket and trowsers, thin
and threadbare, that Mrs. Sharp had made for
him out of some worn-out garment which her
husband had thrown aside, and which were now
rent in many places; a pair of dilapidated yarn
stockings, with feet like a honey-comb. His
shoes, the pair given him by his mother, had
been half-soled once, but were again so far gone
that his stockings protruded in several places,
and yet neither his master nor mistress seemed
to take any notice of their condition, and he
was afraid to ask for a new pair. When it
rained or snowed, or, worse, when it rained
with or after the snow, as it had done several
times within a week, his shoes were but a poor
protection for his feet. The snow and water
went through them as through a sieve.</p>

<p>Before the first of February, the poor boy was
almost crippled with the chilblains. Through
the day, he hobbled about as best he could, often
in great pain; and at night the tender skin of
his feet, irritated by the warmth of the bed,
would keep him awake for hours with a most
intolerable burning and itching.</p>

<p>"Why don't you walk straight? What do
you go shuffling along in that kind of style for?"
said Sharp to him one day, toward the last of
January.</p>

<p>"My feet are so sore," replied Henry, with a
look of suffering, blended with patient endurance.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with them, ha?" asked
his master, glancing down at the miserable
apologies for shoes and stockings that but partially
protected the child's feet from the snow
whenever he stepped beyond the threshold.</p>

<p>"They're frosted, sir," said Henry.</p>

<p>"Frosted, ha? Pull off your shoes and stockings,
and let me see."</p>

<p>Henry drew off an old shoe, tied on with
various appliances of twine and leather-strings;
and then removed a stocking that, through many
gaping holes, revealed the red and shining skin
beneath. That little foot was a sight to pain the
heart of any one but a cruel tyrant. The heel,
in many places, was of a dark purple, and seemed
as if mortification were already begun. And in
some places it was cracked open, and exhibited
running sores.</p>

<p>"Take off your other shoe and stocking,"
said Sharp, in an authoritative tone.</p>

<p>Henry obeyed, trembling all the while. This
foot exhibited nearly the same marks of the
progress of the painful disease.</p>

<p>"What have you done for it?" asked Sharp,
looking Henry in the face with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Nothing but put a little candle-grease on it
at night before I went to bed," replied the child.</p>

<p>"Come out here with me. I'll doctor you,"
said his master, turning away and disappearing
through the back door. Henry followed as
quickly as he could walk on his bare feet, that
seemed ready to give way under him at every
step. When he got as far as the kitchen, he
found Sharp waiting for him in the door.</p>

<p>"Here, jump out into that snow-bank!" said
he, pointing to a pile of snow that had been
shovelled up only that morning, after a fall
through the night, and lay loose and high.</p>

<p>The poor boy looked down at his crippled,
and, indeed, bleeding feet, and, as may well be
supposed, hesitated to comply with the peremptory
order.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, sir?" exclaimed his master
seizing him by the collar, and pushing him out
into the yard. Then catching him by one arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
he set him in the centre of the snow-bank, his
naked feet and legs going down into it some
twelve or eighteen inches.</p>

<p>"Now stand there until I tell you to come
out!"</p>

<p>The child did not scream, for he had already
learned to bear pain, without uttering even the
natural language of suffering; although the
agony he endured for the next minute was terrible.
At the end of that time, a motion of the
head of his master gave him to understand that
the ordeal was over.</p>

<p>"Now take that bucket of cold water, and let
him put his feet into it," said he to a little girl
they had just taken to raise, and who stood near
the kitchen window, her heart almost ready to
burst at the cruelty inflicted upon the only one
in the house with whom she had a single feeling
in common.</p>

<p>The girl quickly obeyed, and sat down on the
floor beside the bucket of water. She handled
tenderly the blood red feet of the little boy, ever
and anon looking up into his face, and noting,
with tender solicitude, the deep lines of suffering
upon his forehead.</p>

<p>"There, that will do," said Sharp, who stood
looking on, "and now run up stairs and get a
better pair of stockings for Henry."</p>

<p>"What do you want with a better pair of
stockings?" said Mrs. Sharp, a few moments
after, bustling down into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Why, I want them for Henry," replied her
husband.</p>

<p>"Want them for Henry!" she exclaimed, in
surprise. "Where's the ones he had on?"</p>

<p>"There are some old rags in the shop that he
had on; but they won't do now, with such feet
as he's got."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with his feet, I'd like to
know," inquired Mrs. Sharp.</p>

<p>"Why, they're frosted."</p>

<p>"Let him put them in snow, then. That'll
cure 'em. It's nothing but a little snow-burn,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"It's something a little worse than that," replied
Sharp, "and he must have a comfortable
pair of stockings. And here, Anna, do you run
around to Stogies, and tell him to send me three
or four pairs of coarse shoes, about Henry's
size."</p>

<p>Anna, the little girl, disappeared with alacrity,
and Mr. Sharp, turning to his wife, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henry must have a good, warm pair of
stockings, or we shall have him sick on our
hands."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll find him a pair," replied Mrs.
Sharp, going off up stairs. In the mean time,
Henry still sat with his feet in the cold water.
But the pain occasioned by the snow was nearly
all gone. Mrs. Sharp came down with the
stockings, and Anna came in with the shoes at
the same moment. On lifting the child's feet
from the water, the redness and inflammation
had a good deal subsided. Mrs. Sharp rubbed
them with a little sweet oil, and then gave him
the stockings to put on. He next tried the shoes,
and one pair of them fitted him very well. But
his feet were too sore and tender for such hard
shoes, and when they were on, and tied up
around the ankles, he found that after getting
up they hurt him most dreadfully in his attempt
to walk. But he hobbled, as best he could, into
the shop.</p>

<p>"Throw them dirty things into the street!"
were the only words addressed to him by Sharp,
who pointed at his wet apologies for shoes and
stockings, still lying upon the floor.</p>

<p>Henry did as directed, but every step he took
was as if he were treading upon coals of fire.
His feet, now enveloped in a closely fitting pair
of woollen stockings, and galled by the hard and
unyielding leather of the new shoes, itched and
burned with maddening fervor.</p>

<p>"Here, carry this hat home," said his master,
as he came in from the street, not seeming to
notice the expression of suffering that was on
his face, nor the evident pain with which he
walked.</p>

<p>Henry took the hat, and started out. He was
but a few paces from the shop, before he found
that the shoes rubbed both heels, and pressed
upon them at the same time so hard as to produce
a sensation at each step as if the skin
were torn off. Sometimes he would stop, and
wait a moment or two, until the intolerable pain
subsided, and then he would walk on again with
all the fortitude and power of endurance he
could command. In this extreme suffering, the
uppermost thought in his mind, when on the
street, kept his eyes wandering about, and scanning
every female form that came in sight, in
the ever-living hope of seeing his mother. But
the sigh of disappointment told, too frequently,
that he looked in vain. He had not proceeded
far, when the pains in his feet became so acute
that he paused, and leaned against a tree-box,
unable, for a time, to move forward a single
step. While resting thus, Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;, who
had been called to visit a patient in Lexington,
came past in his carriage and noticed him. There
was something about the child, although so
changed that he did not recognize him, that
aroused the doctor's sympathies, and he ordered
his man to drive up to the pavement and stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, my little man, what's the matter?"
said he, leaning out of his carriage window.</p>

<p>Henry looked up into his face, but did not reply.
He knew Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; instantly. How
strong a hope sprang up in his heart&mdash;the hope
of hearing from or being taken back to his mother!
The kind-hearted physician needed no
words to tell him that the little boy was suffering
acutely. The flushed face, the starting eye, and
the corrugation of the brow, were language
which he understood as plainly as spoken words.</p>

<p>"What ails you, my little boy?" he said, in a
voice of tender concern.</p>

<p>The feelings of Henry softened under the
warmth of true sympathy expressed in the
countenance and tone of Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;, and still
looking him steadily in the face, essayed, but in
vain, to answer the question.</p>

<p>"Are you sick, my boy?" asked the doctor,
with real and increasing concern for the poor
child.</p>

<p>"My feet hurt me so that I can hardly walk,"
replied Henry, whose tongue at last obeyed his
efforts to speak.</p>

<p>"And what ails your feet?" asked Doctor
R&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>"They've been frosted, sir."</p>

<p>"Frosted, indeed! poor child! Well, what
have you done for them?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;only I greased them sometimes at
night; and to-day my master made me stand in
the snow."</p>

<p>"The cruel wretch!" muttered Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;
between his teeth. "But can't you walk up as
far as the drug store at the corner, and let me
see your feet?" continued the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the child, though he felt
that to take another step was almost impossible.</p>

<p>"You'll come right up, will you?" urged the
doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," returned Henry, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Then I'll wait for you. But come along as
quickly as you can;" and so saying, the doctor
drove off. But he could not help glancing back,
after he had gone on about the distance of half
a square, for his heart misgave him for not
having taken the little fellow into his carriage.
He soon caught a glimpse of him on the sidewalk,
slowly and laboriously endeavoring to
work his way along, but evidently with extreme
suffering. He at once gave directions to the
driver to turn back; and taking Henry into the
carriage, hurried on to the office. The child,
when lifted in, sank back upon the seat, pale
and exhausted. Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; asked him no
question; and when the carriage stopped, directed
the driver to carry him in. He then, with his
own hands, carefully removed his shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p>"My poor, poor child!" said he, in pity and
astonishment, on beholding the condition of
Henry's feet. The harsh remedy prescribed by
Sharp, if the subsequent treatment had been
tender and judicious, might have been salutary;
but, after it, to confine the boy's feet in hard,
tight new shoes, and to send him out upon the
street, was to induce a high state of inflammation,
and, in the advanced state of the chilblains,
to endanger mortification. Several of the large
ulcerous cracks, which were bleeding freely, the
doctor dressed, and then, cutting a number a
short strips of adhesive plaster, he applied them
to the skin over the heel and foot, in various
directions, so as almost completely to cover every
portion of the surface.</p>

<p>"How does that feel?" he asked, looking into
Henry's face with an air of relief and satisfaction,
after he had finished the first foot.</p>

<p>"It feels a good deal better," replied the child,
his voice and the expression of his countenance
both indicating that he no longer suffered so
excruciatingly as he had but a short time previously.</p>

<p>The other foot was soon dressed in the same
way. Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; then went back into the
house and got a loose pair of stockings and a
light pair of shoes, belonging to one of the
apothecary's children, from their mother. These
fitted Henry comfortably, and when he stood
down upon his feet he did not experience any
pain.</p>

<p>"That feels a good deal better, don't it?" said
the doctor, smiling.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed it does," and Henry looked his
gratitude; and yet, blended with that look, was
an expression that seemed to the doctor an appeal
for protection.</p>

<p>"You're afraid to go back now, ain't you,
since you've stayed so long?" he asked, in a
tone meant to encourage the child's confidence.</p>

<p>"Indeed I am. Mr. Sharp will be almost
sure to beat me."</p>

<p>"What a very devil incarnate the man must
be!" muttered Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; to himself, taking
three or four strides across the floor. "I shall
have to take the little fellow home, and brow-beat
his master, I suppose," he continued. Then
addressing Henry, he said, aloud&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take you home to him in my
carriage, and settle all that for you, my little
man; so don't be frightened."</p>

<p>Acting upon this resolution, Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;
soon drove up before the hatter's shop, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
lifting out Henry himself, led him into the presence
of his astonished master.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked the latter,
roughly, and with a forbidding aspect of countenance.</p>

<p>"The matter is simply this, sir," responded
Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;, firmly. "I found this little boy
of yours on the street absolutely unable to get
along a step farther; and on taking him into the
drug store above, and examining his feet, I found
them in a most shocking condition! Why, sir,
in twelve hours mortification would have commenced,
when nothing could have saved his
life but the amputation of both limbs." The
sober earnestness of Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; caused Sharp
to feel some alarm, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had no idea, doctor, that he was as bad as
that."</p>

<p>"Well, he is, I can assure you, and it is a
fortunate thing that I happened to come across
him. Why, I haven't seen so bad a case of
chilblains these ten years."</p>

<p>"What ought I to do for him, doctor?" asked
Sharp, in real concern.</p>

<p>"I have done all that is necessary at present,"
replied the doctor. "But he must be suffered
to have rest; and, as you value his limbs, don't
let him be exposed to the wet or cold until his
feet are healed, and the tenderness and soreness
are both gone."</p>

<p>"I shall attend to your direction, most certainly,"
said Sharp, his manner greatly changed
from what it was when the doctor came in.
"But, really, doctor," he continued, "I had no
idea that there was any danger in getting the
feet a little frosted."</p>

<p>"The chilblains are not only extremely painful,"
replied Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;, "but there is great
danger, where the feet are exposed to wet and
cold, as Henry's must have been to get in the
condition they are, of mortification supervening.
That little boy will require great care, or he will
stand a chance of being crippled for life. Good-morning!"</p>

<p>Poor Henry! How eagerly had he hung upon
the doctor's words! how almost agonizing had
been his desire for even the slightest intimation
that he was remembered by the physician, to
whose mistaken kind offices he was indebted for
the place he held in the family of Sharp! But
all was in vain. A dozen times he was on the
eve of asking for his mother; but, as often, weak
timidity held him back. In the presence of his
master, fear kept him dumb. It seemed to him
as if life would go out when he saw Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;
turn away from the shop and enter his carriage.
A deep darkness fell upon his spirit.</p>

<p>As Doctor R&mdash;&mdash; rode off in his carriage, he
could not help congratulating himself on the
good deed he had performed. Still he did not
feel altogether satisfied about the boy. He had
been so much concerned for his distressed situation,
that he had failed to make any inquiries of
him in regard to his friends; and for this he
blamed himself, because it was clear that, if the
child had friends, they ought to know his condition.
He blamed himself for this thoughtlessness,
and a consciousness of having performed
but half of his duty to the poor boy caused a
shade of concern to steal over him, which he
could not shake off.</p>

<p>And Henry, as he stood frightened in the
shop, felt, as the carriage-wheels rattled away,
the hope that had awakened, faint and trembling
in his heart, sinking into the gloom of despair.
One who could have told him of his mother;
one who, if he had only taken the courage to
have mentioned his name, could have taken
tidings of his condition to her, or perhaps would
have carried him home, had been beside him for
half an hour, and he had not spoken out. And
now he was gone. He felt so sick and weak
that he could hardly stand.</p>

<p>From his sad, waking dreams he was roughly
startled by the loud, sharp voice of his mistress,
who, attracted by the strong expressions of Doctor
R&mdash;&mdash;, now entered the shop, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's all this? What's that little wretch
been doing now, ha?"</p>

<p>"I wish I'd never seen him!" muttered Sharp,
but in a tone that left no doubt on the mind of
his wife that something more than usually annoying
had occurred.</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What's he been doing?
Not stealing, I hope; though I shouldn't wonder."</p>

<p>"He's sick, and you've got to take care of
him," was the dogged answer of Sharp.</p>

<p>"Sick! He looks sick, don't he?" The tones
of the virago were full of contempt.</p>

<p>Any eye but hers would have seen sickness,
sorrow, suffering, and want in the pale, frightened
face of the poor boy, as he stood trembling
beside the counter, and actually clinging to it
for support.</p>

<p>"Who was that in here, just now?" she added.</p>

<p>"Doctor R&mdash;&mdash;, of Boston," replied the hatter,
who knew the doctor by sight very well.</p>

<p>"What did he want?"</p>

<p>"He picked Henry up in the street and took
him over to the drug store at the corner. Then
he brought him home in his carriage. He says
that he must be taken care of, or he will become
a cripple; that it's the worst case of chilblains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
he ever saw; and that his feet are in danger of
mortification."</p>

<p>"I don't believe a word of it. Here! you go
off up stairs," speaking sharply, and with a
threatening look, to the child. "I'd like to
know what business he has to come here, meddling
in affairs that don't concern him."</p>

<p>Henry, thus spoken to, let go of the counter,
by which he was sustaining himself, and attempted
to move towards the door. As he did
so, his face grew deadly pale. He staggered
across the shop, fell against the wall, and then
sank down upon the floor. Mrs. Sharp sprang
towards him, not with any humane intention,
we are sorry to say; but, ere she had grasped the
boy's arm, and given him the purposed jerk, the
sight of his ashen, lifeless face prevented the
outrage. Exhausted nature could bear nothing
more, and protected herself in a temporary suspension
of her power. Henry had fainted, and
it was well that it was so. The fact was a
stronger argument in his favor than any external
exhibition of suffering that could have been
given.</p>

<p>The hatter and his wife were both alarmed at
an event so unexpected by either of them.
Henry was quickly removed to a chamber, and
every effort made to restore him. It was not
a very long time before the machinery of life
was again in motion; its action, however, was
feeble, as even his oppressors could see. Self-interest,
and fear of consequences, if not humanity,
prompted more consideration for the
boy, and secured for him a few days' respite.
After that, the oppressed and his oppressors
assumed their old relations.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<p>"I <span class="smcapa">DON'T</span> think I've seen anything of Lizzy
Glenn for a week," remarked Berlaps to his
man Michael one day during the latter part of
December. "Has she anything out?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She has four of our finest shirts."</p>

<p>"How long since she took them away?"</p>

<p>"It's over a week&mdash;nearly ten days."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Then she ought to be looked after.
It certainly hasn't taken her all this time to
make four shirts."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. She gets along, somehow,
poorly enough," replied Michael. "She's
often been a whole week making four of them."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, the
subject of it entered. She came in with a slow,
feeble step, and leaned against the counter as
she laid down the bundle of work she had
brought with her. Her half-withdrawn veil
showed her face to be very pale, and her eyes
much sunken. A deep, jarring cough convulsed
her frame for a moment or two, causing her to
place her hand almost involuntarily upon her
breast, as if she suffered pain there.</p>

<p>"It's a good while since you took these shirts
out, Lizzy," said Berlaps, in a tone meant to
reprove her for the slowness with which she
worked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," she replied, in a low, sad tone.
"I can't get along very fast. I have a constant
pain in my side. And there are other reasons."</p>

<p>The last sentence was spoken only half aloud,
but sufficiently distinct for Berlaps to hear it.</p>

<p>"I don't expect my workwomen," he said, a
little sharply, "to have any reasons for not
finishing my work in good season, and bringing
it in promptly. Ten days to four shirts is unpardonable.
You can't earn your salt at that."</p>

<p>The young woman made no reply to this, but
stood with her eyes drooping to the floor, and
her hands leaning hard upon the counter to
support herself.</p>

<p>Berlaps then commenced examining the shirts.
The result of this examination seemed to soften
him a little. No wonder; they were made fully
equal to those for which regular shirt-makers
receive from seventy-five cents to a dollar a
piece.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you can make five such as
these in a week&mdash;or even six?" he asked, in a
somewhat changed tone.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not," was the reply. "There's
a good day's work on each one of them, and I
cannot possibly sit longer than a few hours at a
time. And, besides, there are two or three
hours of every day that I must attend to other
duties."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can't, I suppose you can't,"
said the tailor, in a disappointed, half-offended
tone, and turned away from the counter and
walked back to his desk, from which he called
out to his salesman, after he had stood there for
about a minute&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pay her for them, Michael, and if you have
any more ready give her another lot."</p>

<p>Since the sharp rebuke given by Mr. Perkins,
Michael had treated Lizzy with less vulgar assurance.
Sometimes he would endeavor to sport
a light word with her, but she never replied, nor
seemed to notice his freedom in the least. This
uniform, dignified reserve, so different from the
demeanor of most of the girls who worked for
them, coupled with the manner of Perkins's interference
for her, inspired in his mind a feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
of respect for the stranger, which became her
protection from his impertinences. On this occasion,
he merely asked her how many she
would have, and on receiving her answer,
handed her the number of shirts she desired.</p>

<p>As she turned to go out, Mrs. Gaston, who
had just entered, stood near, with her eyes fixed
upon her. She started as she looked into her
face. Indeed, both looked surprised, excited,
then confused, and let their eyes fall to the floor.
They seemed for a moment to have identified
each other, and then to have become instantly
conscious that they were nothing but strangers&mdash;that
such an identification was impossible. An
audible sigh escaped Lizzy Glenn, as she passed
slowly out and left the store. As she reached
the pavement, she turned and looked back at
Mrs. Gaston. Their eyes again met for an instant.</p>

<p>"Who is that young woman?" asked Mrs.
Gaston.</p>

<p>"Her name is Lizzy Glenn," replied Michael.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about her?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;only that she's a proud, stiff kind
of a creature; though what she has to be proud
of, is more than I can tell."</p>

<p>"How long has she been working for you?"</p>

<p>"A couple of months or so, if I recollect
rightly."</p>

<p>"Where does she live?" was Mrs. Gaston's
next question.</p>

<p>Michael gave her the direction, and then
their intercourse had entire reference to business.</p>

<p>After the subject of this brief conversation
between Mrs. Gaston and Michael left the store
of Mr. Berlaps, she walked slowly in the direction
of her temporary home, which was, as has
before been mentioned, in an obscure street at
the north end. It consisted of a small room, in
an old brick house, which had been made by
running a rough partition through the centre of
the front room in the second story, and then
intersecting this partition on one side by another
partition, so as to make three small rooms out
of one large one. These partitions did not reach
more than two-thirds of the distance to the
ceiling, thus leaving a free circulation of air in
the upper and unobstructed portion of the room.
As the house stood upon a corner, and contained
windows both in front and on the end, each
room had a window. The whole were heated
by one large stove. For the little room that
Lizzy Glenn occupied, including fire, she paid
seventy-five cents a week. But, as the house
was old, the windows open, and the room that
had been cut up into smaller ones a large one;
and, moreover, as the person who let them and
supplied fuel for the stove took good care to see
that an undue quantity of this fuel was not
burned, she rarely found the temperature of her
apartment high enough to be comfortable. Those
who occupied the other two rooms, in each of
which, like her own, was a bed, a couple of
chairs, and a table, with a small looking-glass,
were seamstresses, who were compelled, as she
was, to earn a scanty subsistence by working
for the slop-shops. But they could work many
more hours than she could, and consequently
earned more money than she was able to do.
Her food&mdash;the small portion she consumed&mdash;she
provided herself, and prepared it at the stove,
which was common property.</p>

<p>On returning from the tailor's, as has been
seen, she laid her bundle of work upon the bed,
and seated herself with a thoughtful air, resting
her head upon her hand. The more she thought,
the more she seemed disturbed; and finally
arose, and commenced walking the floor slowly.
Suddenly pausing, at length, she sighed heavily,
and went to the bed upon which lay her work,
took it up, unrolled the bundle, and seating
herself by the table, entered once more upon
her daily toil. But her mind was too much
disturbed, from some cause, to permit her to
pursue her work steadily. In a little while she
laid aside the garment upon which she had begun
to sew, and, leaning forward, rested her
head upon the table, sighing heavily as she did
so, and pressing one hand hard against her side,
as if to relieve pain. A tap at the door aroused
her from this state of abstraction. As she
turned, the door was quietly opened, and the
woman she had seen at the tailor's, a short time
before, entered. She started to her feet at this
unexpected apparition, and gazed, with a look
of surprise, inquiry, and hope, upon her visitor.</p>

<p>"Can it be Mrs. Gaston? But no! no!" and
the young creature shook her head mournfully.</p>

<p>"Eugenia!" exclaimed Mrs. Gaston, springing
forward, and instantly the two were locked in
each other's arms, and clinging together with
convulsive eagerness.</p>

<p>"But no, no! It cannot be my own Eugenia,"
said Mrs. Gaston, slowly disengaging herself,
and holding the young woman from her, while
she read over every feature of her pale, thin
face. "Surely I am in a strange dream!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am your own Eugenia Ballantine!
my more than mother! Or, the wreck of her,
which a wave of life's ever restless ocean has
heaved upon the shore."</p>

<p>"Eugenia Ballantine! How can it be! Lost
years ago at sea, how can she be in this room,
and in this condition! It is impossible! And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
yet you are, you must be, my own dear Eugenia."</p>

<p>"I am! I am!" sobbed the maiden, leaning
her head upon the bosom of Mrs. Gaston, and
weeping until the tears fell in large drops upon
the floor.</p>

<p>"But the sea gives not up its dead," said Mrs.
Gaston in a doubting, bewildered tone.</p>

<p>"True&mdash;but the sea never claimed me as a
victim."</p>

<p>"And your father?"</p>

<p>The maiden's face flushed a moment, while a
shade of anguish passed over it.</p>

<p>"At another time, I will tell you all. My
mind is now too much agitated and confused.
But why do I find you here? And more than
all, why as a poor seamstress, toiling for little
more than a crust of bread and a cup of water?
Where is your husband? Where are your children?"</p>

<p>"Three years ago," replied Mrs. Gaston, "we
removed to this city. My husband entered into
business, and was unsuccessful. He lost everything,
and about a year ago, died, leaving me
destitute. I have struggled on, since then, the
best I could, but to little purpose. The pittance
I have been able to earn at the miserable prices
we are paid by the tailors has scarcely sufficed
to keep my children from starving. But one of
them"&mdash;and the mother's voice trembled&mdash;"my
sweet Ella! was not permitted to remain with
me, when I could no longer provide things comfortable
for my little ones. A few short weeks
ago, she was taken away to a better world. It
was a hard trial, but I would not have her back
again. And Henry, the dear boy, you remember&mdash;I
have been forced to let him go from my side
out into the world. I have neither seen nor
heard from him since I parted with him. Emma
alone remains."</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston's feelings so overcame her at this
relation, that she wept and sobbed for some time.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Eugenia!&mdash;my child that I
loved so tenderly, and have so long mourned as
lost," she said, at length, drawing her arm affectionately
around Miss Ballantine, "in better and
happier times, we made one household for more
than five pleasant years. Let us not be separated
now, when there are clouds over our heads, and
sorrow on our paths. Together we shall be able
to bear up better and longer than when separated.
I have a room, into which I moved a week since,
that is pleasanter than this. One room, one bed,
one fire, and one light, will do for two as well as
one. We shall be better able to contend with
our lot together. Will you come with me,
Eugenia?"</p>

<p>"Will I not, Mrs. Gaston? Oh! to be once
more with you! To have one who can love me
as you will love me! One to whom I can unburden
my heart&mdash;Oh, I shall be too happy!"</p>

<p>And the poor creature hung upon the neck of
her maternal friend, and wept aloud.</p>

<p>"Then come at once," said Mrs. Gaston.
"You have nothing to keep you here?"</p>

<p>"No, nothing," replied Eugenia.</p>

<p>"I will get some one to take your trunk."
And Mrs. Gaston turned away and left the room.
In a little while, she came back with a man, who
removed the trunk to her humble dwelling-place.
Thence we will follow them.</p>

<p>"And now, my dear Eugenia," said Mrs.
Gaston, after they had become settled down,
and their minds had assumed a more even flow,
"clear up to me this strange mystery. Why are
you here, and in this destitute condition? How
did you escape death? Tell me all, or I shall
still think myself only in the bewildering mazes
of a dream."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MOTHERS_LESSON" id="THE_MOTHERS_LESSON"></a>THE MOTHER'S LESSON.</h2>

<p class="p5a">A STORY FROM A GERMAN BALLAD.</p>

<p class="p6">BY ELMA SOUTH.</p>


<p>'T<span class="smcapa">WAS</span> night, the star-gemmed and glittering,
when a bereaved mother lay tossing on her bed
in all the feverish restlessness of unsanctified
sorrow. Sleep had fled far from her weary eye-lids;
and her grief-burdened heart refused to
send up from its troubled fountains the refreshing
stream of prayer.</p>

<p>The deep stillness that rested on the hushed
earth was broken by those saddest of all sounds,
the bitter wailings of a mother weeping for her
children, and "refusing to be comforted because
they are not."</p>

<p>"Oh, woe, woe is me!" was the piteous cry
of that breaking heart, and the piercing sound
went up to the still heavens; but they looked
calmly down in their starry beauty and seemed
to hear it not.</p>

<p>And thus slowly passed the long, weary hours
of the night, and naught was heard save the
solemn chiming of the clock, telling, with iron
tongue, that man was drawing hourly nearer to
the quiet grave.</p>

<p>And as the mourner lay listening to Time's
slow, measured strokes, Memory was busy with
the images of the loved and lost. Again they
were before her in all their youthful beauty; she
heard their gleeful voices and felt their fond
caresses. The night wind swept coolingly into
the casement, and, as it touched her throbbing
brow, it seemed like the soft kisses of her loving
children.</p>

<p>Poor mourner! Could earth furnish no magic
mirror in which thou couldst always thus see
the dead living? Oh, no! for as melts the
fleecy cloud in to the blue depths of heaven, so
passed away the blessed vision; and seeing but
the coffin and the shroud, again arose on the
silent air those tones of despairing anguish:
"Woe is me! my sons are dead!"</p>

<p>Then softly and sweetly sounded forth the
matin chimes, blending their holy music with
the anguished cries of the bereaved mother. In
the midst of her sorrow, she heard the bells'
sweet harmony, and, leaving her sleepless couch,
walked forth into the refreshing air. Morning
was breaking cold and gray over the earth, and
the stars were growing pale at the approaching
step of the monarch of the day.</p>

<p>Slowly walks the mourner through the yet
sleeping woods, whose flowers are folded in
silence, and whose birds give forth no carols.
She reaches the antique church and enters the
sacred doors. A mysterious light&mdash;light that is
almost shade&mdash;is brooding over the holy aisles,
clothing in shadowy garments the pale images
of departed saints; wrapping in mantle of dimness
the carved sepulchres; throwing strange
gleams over the tall white columns; and embracing,
with pale arms, cross and picture, and
antique shrine. In the midst of this mysterious
light kneel a silent company; each head is
bowed on the clasped hands, and no sound is
heard save a deep, far distant murmuring, like
the voice of the mighty wind when it passes
through the leaves of the dark, old pines, dwelling
in some dim, solemn woods.</p>

<p>Suddenly every head is lifted, and the mourner
sees in that vast company friends who had been
sleeping long ages in the silent tomb. All were
there again; the friend of her cloudless childhood,
who went down to death's cold chambers
in all her stainless beauty, sinking into the
grave as pure as the snow-flake that falls to the
earth. And there was the sister of her home
and heart, the tried friend of sorrow's shaded
hours, who, in dying, left a mighty void that
time could never fill. And there were the
"mighty dead," they whose footsteps, when
living, tracked the world with light&mdash;light that
now shed a halo over their graves. And there
were the meek, patient ones of earth, pale martyrs
to sorrow, who struggled hopefully through
the dim vapors that surround the world, and
met as a reward the ineffable brightness of
heaven. They were all here, all who had passed
from earth amidst a fond tribute of tears and
regrets.</p>

<p>All were here save two, those two the most
dearly loved among the precious company of the
dead; and wildly scanning the pale group, the
mother called aloud as she missed her children:
"Oh, my sons! my sons! would that I could
see them but once again!"</p>

<p>Then arose a loud voice, and it said: "Look
to the east;" and the weeping mother looked.</p>

<p>Oh! dreadful sight! there, by the sacred altar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
rested a block and a fearful wheel. Stretched
on these dreadful instruments of doom, in the
coarse garb of the prison, wrestling fiercely with
death in its most awful form, were two poor
youths; and in their wan countenances, where
crime and grief had traced their fearful march,
the mother recognized her lost sons.</p>

<p>Dismayed, heart-sick, despairing, she motionless
stands; and the deep silence is again broken
by a voice speaking these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mourner, whose every tone is a murmur at
Heaven's will, whose every expression is a doubt
of God's love, let this teach thee a mighty truth.
See the dark path of crime they might have
trod; see the agony, the shame, the maternal
anguish that might have swept like a desolating
tempest over thy heart; then thank thy God, in
a burst of fervent praise, that he took them in
unsullied youth from a world of sin to a place
of safe refuge."</p>

<p>The voice ceased, and darkness fell like a pall
on the marble floor; but through the arched
windows came streaming the pale moonlight,
and beneath its holy rays, the mother knelt and
prayed.</p>

<p>There fell on her heart a blessed calm, as a
voice whispered to the troubled waves of sorrow,
"peace, be still."</p>

<p>And the angel of death stole softly in, and
sealed her pale lips forever, whilst repentance
and resignation were breathing from them in the
music of prayer.</p>

<p>Oh, weeping mother! who art hanging garlands
of sorrow ever fresh over thy children's
tombs, take to thy bereaved heart, and ponder
well, this "Mother's Lesson!"</p>

<h2>TEACHING AT HOME.</h2>

<p class="p5a">LANGUAGE.</p>


<p>A<span class="smcapa">S</span> we are desirous of pointing out in what
respects parents may assist in the education of
their children previous to their being sent to
school, we must remind them that it is at home
that a child learns to speak; and that there is,
perhaps, nothing which helps more towards his
after instruction than the power of speaking
well. There are sometimes very strange notions
on this subject amongst fathers and mothers.
They think, as long as they themselves can understand
a child when it begins to talk, that it is
sufficient. They are rather pleased than otherwise
that the baby should have its own names
for the things it wants, and the parent learns to
use these words for the accommodation of the
child. Instead of being helped forward in its
progress to plain speaking, it is allowed for
several years to express itself in a strange sort of
gibberish, which is only laughed at and admired
by the rest of the family. The mother will tell
with a sort of satisfaction that little Susan can
never use the letter S, or the letter W; and no
effort is made by her to conquer the difficulty.
She does not foresee, as most probably will be the
case, that this will be a sort of stumbling-block
in little Susan's way when she goes to school,
and that she will pass for a sort of dunce, perhaps,
for a year or two, in consequence of her
inability to read as well as other children of her
age. When she stands up in her class and begins
to read her portion of the lesson, she is told by
the rest of the children that they cannot understand
a word that she reads; and the patience
of her teacher is sorely tried, in vain attempts to
get a few words distinctly uttered. And when
Susan leaves school at last to enter upon her
occupation in life&mdash;say that of teacher&mdash;it is ten
to one that her imperfect utterance does not
stand in her way in getting a place; for mothers,
who are well educated, like that their children
should be with those who speak well, and in the
first interview with Susan, the imperfection in
her speech is discovered. The same, perhaps,
with Willy, her brother, who finds himself
rejected several times by persons to whom he
offers himself to fill some situation for which he
is perfectly well qualified, only that the gentlemen
think he must be but a rough sort of lad
from the countrified way in which he answers
the questions put to him. Clearness and correctness
of speech have also another advantage in
securing correctness and clearness of thoughts.
A child who is made to put the right word to
everything and to pronounce it properly&mdash;to use
the right expression in describing what he sees,
or in telling what he has done&mdash;knows and understands
better than one who makes up words
or expressions for himself; and a mother or
father can, if they be not very bad speakers
themselves, early accustom their children to
choose the right names for things instead of the
wrong in their talk. We all know that in many
counties of England, the people living there
have words peculiar to themselves for many
things, different from the way in which they are
called in London, or in the great towns; at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
same time that they know quite well what are
the right names and words used by the well
educated. From early habit they like to use
these words, which perhaps remind them of
their own childhood or their home in early life;
but it would be as well to remember that to their
children it would be an advantage to use the
more correct words and expressions, and therefore
worth their while to make an effort to
employ them. It is also of great importance
that the <em>pronunciation</em>, or way of sounding
words, should be correct. In these counties, for
instance, it is the habit of the people not to
sound the letter H at the beginning of a word;
and though this may seem a very trifling matter,
it may on many occasions in life go greatly
against a young person, should he or she talk of
a <em>orse</em> or a <em>ouse</em>, instead of a <em>horse</em> or a <em>house</em>.
The persons so speaking may have learned to read
very correctly, and write well, and be possessed
of a good stock of useful knowledge, and yet
with a very large class of persons they would,
from such a slip of the tongue, be set down as
ignorant and ill educated&mdash;perhaps even be suspected
of a rudeness and vulgarity in thought
and feeling which they were far from being guilty
of. To secure their children against such a
disadvantage, it would be worth while for any
parent who knows how to spell, to take care
that this important letter <em>h</em> is sounded in all
words which it begins, there being only two or
three words in the English in which it is the
custom not to pronounce it, such as <em>hour</em>, <em>heir</em>,
<em>honor</em>, &amp;c., which are soon learned to be exceptions
to the general rule. This habit, it is true, is
peculiar to England; but it shows how carefully
proper habits should be nurtured in childhood.</p>

<p>There is a still more important point for
parents to observe in the language used by their
children, and this is the avoidance of all profane,
vulgar, or indecent words. And in this respect
the parent is most particularly the teacher of his
child. A father who uses an oath in the presence
of his innocent child, teaches that child to
make use of that expression some day in his turn.
A mother who takes the great name of God in
vain, not only sets her child the example of so
doing, but takes away from its young mind
some portion of the reverence which it has
hitherto felt towards the Great Being whom it is
taught to call its "Father in Heaven." Too
much is it the custom, in the most trivial events
of everyday life, to utter that Name which should
never be pronounced but with reverence and
love. It is called upon in moments of anger and
impatience, when the remembrance of His care
and love should lead us to leave the little as well
as the great events of life trustfully in his hands,
knowing as we do that all is ordered and ruled
for our good.</p>

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR TAKING LEAF IMPRESSIONS.</h3>

<p>H<span class="smcapa">OLD</span> oiled paper in the smoke of a lamp, or
of pitch, until it becomes coated with the smoke;
to this paper apply the leaf of which you wish an
impression, having previously warmed it between
your hands, that it may be pliable. Place the
lower surface of the leaf upon the blackened surface
of the oil-paper, that the numerous veins,
which are so prominent on this side, may receive
from the paper a portion of the smoke. Lay a
paper over the leaf, and then press it gently upon
the smoked paper with the fingers, or with a
small roller (covered with woollen cloth, or some
like soft material), so that every part of the leaf
may come in contact with the sooted oil-paper.
A coating of the smoke will adhere to the leaf.
Then remove the leaf carefully, and place the
blackened surface on a sheet of white paper, not
ruled, or in a book prepared for the purpose, covering
the leaf with a clean slip of paper, and
pressing upon it with the fingers, or roller, as
before. Thus may be obtained the impression of
a leaf, showing the perfect outlines, together with
an accurate exhibition of the veins which extend
in every direction through it, more correctly
than the finest drawing. And this process is so
simple, and the materials so easily obtained, that
any person, with a little practice to enable him
to apply the right quantity of smoke to the oil-paper,
and give the leaf a proper pressure, can
prepare beautiful leaf impressions, such as a
naturalist would be proud to possess.</p>

<p>There is another, and we think a better method
of taking <em>leaf impressions</em> than the preceding one.
The only difference in the process consists in the
use of <em>printing-ink</em> instead of smoked oil-paper.</p>

<p>L<span class="smcapa">EAF</span> P<span class="smcapa">RINTING</span>.&mdash;After warming the leaf
between the hands, apply <em>printing-ink</em>, by means
of a small leather ball containing cotton, or some
soft substance, or with the end of the finger.
The leather ball (and the finger when used for
that purpose), after the ink is applied to it,
should be pressed several times upon a piece of
leather, or some smooth surface, before each
application to the leaf, that the ink may be
smoothly and evenly applied.</p>

<p>After the under surface of the leaf has been
sufficiently inked, apply it to the paper, where
you wish the impression; and, after covering it
with a slip of paper, use the hand or roller to
press upon it, as described in the former process.</p>

<h2><a name="FARM_HOUSE" id="FARM_HOUSE"></a>FARM HOUSE.</h2>

<p class="center">[<em>From "Rural Architecture," published by C. M. Saxton, New York.</em>]</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe55" src="images/i_444.jpg" alt="Rural farm house scene" />
</div>


<p>T<span class="smcapa">HIS</span> is a plain and unpretending building in
appearance; yet, in its ample finish, and deeply
drawn and sheltering eaves, broad veranda, and
spacious out-buildings, may give accommodation
to a large family indulging a liberal style of
living.</p>

<p>By an error in the engraving, the main roof
of the house is made to appear like a double, or
gambrel-roof, breaking at the intersection of the
gable, or hanging roof over the ends. This is
not so intended. The roofs on each side are a
straight line of rafters. The Swiss, or hanging
style of gable-roof, is designed to give a more
sheltered effect to the elevation than to run the
end walls to a peak in the point of the roof.</p>

<p>By a defect in the drawing, the roof of the
veranda is not sufficiently thrown over the columns.
This roof should project at least one
foot beyond them, so as to perfectly shelter the
mouldings beneath from the weather, and conform
to the style of the main roof of the house.</p>

<p>The material of which it is built may be of
either stone, brick, or wood, as the taste or convenience
of the proprietor may suggest. The
main building is 44 by 36 feet, on the ground.
The cellar wall may show 18 to 24 inches above
the ground, and be pierced by windows in each
end, as shown in the plan. The height of the
main walls may be two full stories below the
roof plates, or the chambers may run a foot or
two into the garret, at the choice of the builder,
either of which arrangements may be permitted.</p>

<p>The front door opens from a veranda 28 feet
long by 10 feet in depth, drooping eight inches
from the door-sill. This veranda has a hipped
roof, which juts over the columns in due proportion
with the roof of the house over its walls.
These columns are plain, with brackets, or
braces from near their tops, sustaining the plate
and finish of the roof above, which may be covered
either with tin or zinc, painted, or closely
shingled.</p>

<p>The walls of the house may be 18 to 20 feet
high below the plates; the roof a pitch of 30 to
45 degrees, which will afford an upper garret,
or store, or small sleeping rooms, if required;
and the eaves should project two to three feet,
as climate may demand, over the walls. A plain
finish&mdash;that is, ceiled underneath&mdash;is shown in
the design, but brackets on the ends of the rafters,
beaded and finished, may be shown, if
preferred. The gables are <em>Swiss-roofed</em>, or <em>truncated</em>,
thus giving them a most sheltered and
comfortable appearance, particularly in a northerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
climate. The small gable in front relieves
the roof of its monotony, and affords light to the
central garret. The chimneys are carried out
with partition flues, and may be topped with
square caps, as necessity or taste may demand.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe55" src="images/i_445.jpg" alt="GROUND PLAN and CHAMBER PLAN" />
</div>

<p>Retreating three feet from the kitchen side of
the house runs, at right angles, a wing 30 by 18
feet, one and a half stories high, with a veranda
eight feet wide in front. Next in rear of this,
continues a wood-house, 30 by 18 feet, one story
high, with ten-feet posts, and open in front, the
ground level of which is 18 inches below the
floor of the wing to which it is attached. The
roof of these two is of like character with that
of the main building.</p>

<p>Adjoining this wood-house, and at right angles
with it, is a building 68 by 18 feet, projecting
two feet outside the line of wood-house and
kitchen. This building is one and a half stories
high, with twelve feet posts, and roof in the same
style and of equal pitch as the others.</p>

<p><em>Interior Arrangement.</em>&mdash;The front door from
the veranda of the house opens into a hall, 18 by
8 feet, and 11 feet high, amply lighted by sash
windows on the sides, and over the door. From
the rear of this hall runs a flight of easy stairs,
into the upper or chamber hall. On one side of
the lower hall, a door leads into a parlor, 18 feet
square, and 11 feet high, lighted by three windows,
and warmed by an open stove or fireplace,
the pipe passing into a chimney flue in the rear.
A door passes from this parlor into a rear passage,
or entry, thus giving it access to the kitchen
and rear apartments. At the back end of the
front hall, a door leads into the rear passage and
kitchen; and on the side opposite the parlor, a
door opens into the sitting or family room; 18 by
16 feet in area, having an open fireplace, and
three windows. On the hall side of this room,
a door passes into the kitchen, 22 by 16 feet, and
which may, in case the requirements of the family
demand it, be made the chief family or living
room, and the last one described converted into
a library. In this kitchen, which is lighted by
two windows, is a liberal open fireplace, with
an ample oven by its side, and a sink in the outer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
corner. A flight of stairs, also, leads to the rear
chambers above; and a corresponding flight under
them, to the cellar below. A door at each
end of these stairs leads into the back entry of
the house, and thus to the other interior rooms,
or through the rear outer door to the back porch.
This back entry is lighted by a single sash window
over the outside door leading to the porch.
Another door, opposite that leading down cellar,
opens into the passage through the wing. From
the rear hall, which is 16 by 5 feet, the innermost
passage leads into a family bedroom, or nursery,
16 by 14 feet, lighted by a window in each outside
wall, and warmed by an open fireplace, or
stove, at pleasure. Attached to this bedroom is
a clothes-closet, 8 by 4 feet, with shelves and
drawers. Next the outer door, in rear end of the
hall, is a small closet opening from it, 6 by 4 feet
in dimensions, convertible to any use which the
mistress of the house may direct.</p>

<p>Opening into the wing from the kitchen, first,
is a large closet and pantry, supplied with a
table, drawers, and shelves, in which are stored
the dishes, table furniture, and edibles necessary
to be kept at a moment's access. This room
is 14 by 8 feet, and well lighted by a window of
convenient size. If necessary, this room may
have a partition, shutting off a part from the
everyday uses which the family requires. In
this room, so near to the kitchen, to the sink, to
hot water, and the other little domestic accessories
which good housewives know so well how
to arrange and appreciate, all the nice little table-comforts
can be got up, and perfected, and stored
away, under lock and key, in drawer, tub, or jar,
at their discretion, and still their eyes not be
away from their subordinates in the other departments.
Next to this, and connected by a door,
is the dairy, or milk-room, also 14 by 8 feet;
which, if necessary, may be sunk three or four
feet into the ground, for additional coolness in
the summer season, and the floor reached by
steps. In this are ample shelves for the milk-pans,
convenience of churning, &amp;c. &amp;c. But, if
the dairy be a prominent object of the farm, a
separate establishment will be required, and the
excavation may not be necessary for ordinary
household uses. Out of this milk-room, a door
leads into a wash-room, 18 by 14 feet. A passage
from the kitchen also leads into this. The
wash-room is lighted by two windows in rear,
and one in front. A sink is between the two rear
windows, with conductor leading outside, and a
closet beneath it, for the iron ware. In the chimney,
at the end, are boilers, and a fireplace, an
oven, or anything else required, and a door leading
to a platform in the wood-house, and so into
the yard. On the other side of the chimney, a
door leads into a bathing-room, 7 by 6 feet, into
which hot water is drawn from one of the boilers
adjoining, and cold water may be introduced,
by a hand-pump, through a pipe leading into the
well or cistern.</p>

<h2>A FEW WORDS ABOUT DELICATE WOMEN.</h2>

<p>H<span class="smcapa">OW</span> essential is it to the well-being of a
family that the wife and mother should be
cheerful, active, and healthy. Yet, looking at
those classes of the community a little above
what may be termed the laboring class, how
frequently we find that the women are ailing,
nervous, and irritable; or, as they would call
themselves, "delicate!" How is this?</p>

<p>"Why," answers one, "some are the children
of unhealthy parents, and the inheritors of their
diseases." Where this is the case, the fullest
sympathy and consideration are due; but the
number of such would be only a few in comparison
with the class we speak of. We must
look further for the cause.</p>

<p>"Oh," suggests another, "is not the fact of
being a wife and mother, and having the care
and management of a family and household,
with perhaps very limited pecuniary resources,
quite enough to make women weak and ailing?"
We think not. Such circumstances are trying;
but with some women they have been the
means of drawing out unwonted cheerfulness
and energy of character. Allowing, however,
that some women are so tried and harassed by the
circumstances of married life that their health
and energy give way; still their number would
be comparatively few, and we must find some
other cause for the fact that there are so many
females who call themselves "delicate."</p>

<p>Is it that they have an impression that there
is something amiable in being delicate?</p>

<p>Do they think it is lady-like to be delicate?</p>

<p>Is not this delicacy cultivated by some as a
means of drawing more largely on sympathy,
especially the husband's sympathy?</p>

<p>Are not idleness and inactivity often excused or
hidden under this convenient cloak of delicacy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span></p>

<p>We think that each of these questions may be
correctly answered in the affirmative, and that
the commencement of these errors, with all their
attendant evils, may be traced to the education
of the girl.</p>

<p>Years ago, Fanny was a healthy, active, and
unaffected child, when her parents sent her to a
boarding-school. For the first few days, feeling
herself among strangers, and away from home,
she was pensive and quiet; but this soon wore
away, and she became cheerful and happy again.
She had taken a skipping-rope with her to
school, and one evening, when she was in the
full enjoyment of the use of it, the evening bell
rang for the scholars to retire for the night.
When Fanny went to say "good-night" to the
governess, she was surprised to hear her say to
the matron: "You will be so good as to give
Miss Fanny a dose of calomel, she is in too robust
health; see, her cheeks are like a milkmaid's."
So Fanny had to take calomel, and
the next day she was languid and listless, or, as
the governess seemed to consider, "lady-like."
Another time, when playing with a companion
somewhat actively in the playground, they were
stopped by a teacher, saying: "Young ladies,
are you not ashamed of yourselves? that is not
the way to conduct yourselves in this establishment.
Why, what would be thought of you?
Pray let me see you walk like young ladies."</p>

<p>Fanny wished then that she was not to be
called a "young lady" if she might not play
and romp about a little, for she was sure it made
her happy to do so. But it is astonishing what
changes may in time be effected by teaching and
example. During the remainder of her stay at
school, Fanny had occasional doses of calomel
when too robust health began to show
itself; and she had learned to believe that, to be
at all respected by her fellow-creatures, she must
be considered a young lady, and that all young
ladies were of delicate constitutions, and that it
was very unlady-like to be healthy and active.</p>

<p>Poor Fanny! she had not only imbibed these
notions, but she had also lost a great deal of
her vigor of constitution, and had become inert
and inactive. When she left school, she returned
to the home of her childhood, where
family arrangements were such that her assistance
would frequently have been acceptable to
her parents. But when anything was requested
of her, it was attended to in a manner so unwilling
and languid, that they soon ceased to ask
anything of her, grieving and wondering what
was become of their cheerful and active Fanny.</p>

<p>Not being aware of Fanny's idea's about ladyism,
and not perceiving that the mind wanted
curing more than the body, her parents consulted
the family doctor, who said that he could not
perceive there was much the matter with her;
he, however, recommended fresh air and exercise,
and suggested that perhaps a few weeks by
the seaside might do her good. Now, this latter
advice Fanny liked very much; it added to her
importance as a lady that she should be taken
to the seaside because she was in delicate health.
However, as Fanny meant to be delicate, she
was as much so on her return as before, until at
last it became an allowed fact in the family that
Fanny was "so delicate" that she was left to do
pretty much as she pleased.</p>

<p>Time passed on, and Fanny became a wife,
and, with a vague idea that she was to secure to
herself the affections of her husband, just in
proportion that she made demands upon his
sympathy, her elegant ailings became more
numerous than ever, and she has fully established
her claim to be classed among "delicate
women."</p>

<p>Perhaps the custom of giving calomel to destroy
health, as if it were a weed too rank to be
allowed to grow, is not very much practised;
but other injurious customs are taught and practised
which as certainly injure health.</p>

<p>The custom of confining the body in tight
stays, or tight clothes of any kind, is exceedingly
hurtful to the health of both body and mind. A
girl has learned a very bad lesson, when she has
been taught that to gain the admiration of her
fellow-creatures, she must, even to the endangering
of health and life, distort her figure from
that which nature has made, to something which
fashion presumes to dictate as more admirable.</p>

<p>The custom of preventing the active use of
the limbs, and free exercise of the body generally,
and restricting every movement to the artificial
notions of boarding-school propriety, is attended
with mental and physical evils of all sorts.
While a child is forbidden to take the bodily
exercise which nature would impel her to do,
the humors grow thick and stagnate for want of
motion to warm and dilate them; the general
circulation is impeded; the muscles stiffen, because
deprived of their necessary moisture; obstructions
take place, which produce weakness
in every animal function; and nature, no longer
able to discharge the morbid matter which constantly
accumulates from all her imperfect operations,
gradually sickens, and the child is either
carried to a premature grave, or continues an
existence of physical and mental languor and
listlessness; and another is added to the class
of "delicate women."</p>

<p>We cannot be far from right in saying that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
almost all the mental and physical ailings of
"delicate women" may be traced to a defective
education. And those who are now engaged in
training girls, whether at home or in schools,
cannot too seriously consider the weight of responsibility
resting upon them. Upon their
management depend much of future health, and,
consequently, the usefulness and happiness of
those committed to their charge.</p>

<p>As requisites to the promotion of bodily vigor,
we will mention:&mdash;</p>

<p>A strict attention to personal cleanliness,
which children should be taught to cultivate,
because it is healthy and right that they should
be clean, and not because "it would look so if
they were dirty!"</p>

<p>The use of apartments that are well ventilated.</p>

<p>Frequent and sufficient active bodily exercise
in the open air.</p>

<p>Entire freedom from any pressure upon the
person by the use of tight clothes.</p>

<p>A sufficiency of nourishing and digestible food.</p>

<p>And, in winter, the use of such firing as is
needed to keep up a healthful warmth.</p>

<p>All these will tend to promote health, but we
shall have no security against "delicate women"
unless there be also added the cultivation of
mental health.</p>

<p>For this, it is necessary that girls should be
taught to cultivate <em>mental purity and mental activity</em>,
by sufficient and well-regulated exercise
of the mind.</p>

<p>Habits of benevolence, contentment, and
cheerful gratitude should be inculcated, both
by precept and example, to the exclusion of
selfishness.</p>

<p>And, above all, should be strongly impressed
upon the mind the necessity of the strictest
integrity, which will lead to the abhorrence of
every species of affectation, which is, indeed,
only a modified sort of deceit.</p>

<p>Girls should also be early taught that they are
responsible beings; responsible to God for the
right use of all the mercies bestowed upon them;
and that health is one of the chief of earthly
blessings, and that it is their duty to value and
preserve it.</p>

<p>But much is learnt from example as well as
from precept; therefore, let no affectation of
languid airs in a teacher give a child the idea
that there can be anything admirable in the
absence of strength. We do not wish that girls
should cultivate anything masculine; for an unfeminine
woman cannot be an object of admiration
to the right judging of either sex. But a
female has no occasion to affect to be feminine;
she is so naturally, and if she will but let nature
have its perfect work, she will, most likely, be
not only feminine, but also graceful and admirable.</p>

<p>The school studies of girls should be so arranged
that they may afford mental food and
satisfaction; otherwise, as soon as the lesson
hours are over, they will, most likely, turn with
avidity to any nonsense they can learn from
foolish conversation, or to reading some of the
trashy books of the day, to the injury of all
mental and moral health, and the almost certain
production of "delicate women."</p>

<p>To those who are already women, and are
unfortunately classed among the "delicate," we
would say: For the sake of your husbands, and
all connected with you, strive resolutely to lose
your claim to such an unenviable distinction.
If you are conscious of the least feeling of satisfaction
in hearing yourself spoken of as delicate,
be assured it is a degree of mental disease that
allows the feeling. If you ever suppose that
you gain your husband's sympathy by weakness,
remember you might gain more of his esteem
and satisfied affection by strength. Fifty years
ago, it was well said that, "To a man of feeling,
extreme delicacy in the partner of his life and
fortune is an object of great and constant concern;
but a <em>semblance</em> of such delicacy, where it
does not really exist, is an insult on his discernment,
and must ultimately inspire him with
aversion and disgust." It is not for us to say
how many put on the semblance of delicacy as
a covering for idleness, or from any of the weak
motives that prompt such an affectation&mdash;conscience
will whisper where this is the case&mdash;and
happy will it be for the household of any one
who can be roused from such a pitiable state.</p>

<p>Could woman only know how many husbands
are bankrupt because their wives are "delicate;"
how many children are physically, mentally,
and morally neglected and ruined, because their
mothers are "delicate;" how many servants
become dishonest and inefficient, because their
mistresses are "delicate"&mdash;the list would be so
appalling that possibly we might hear of an
Anti-delicate-ladies Association, for the better
promotion of family happiness and family economy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, let each listen to her own conscience
and the dictates of her better judgment,
and remember that health is a gift of God, and
we cannot slight a gift without also slighting
the Giver.</p>

  <div class="i0">Alas, I still remember thee!</div>

 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I often gaze with heart unmoved</div>

  <div class="i0">The month was just beginning, and the papers said so too;</div>
  <div class="i0">"A charming number," "brilliant," "a treat for ladies all,"</div>
  <div class="i0">And I wished to see its contents, and read "Fashion" on the fall.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">A rainy afternoon it was&mdash;not a dashing, roaring rain,</div>
  <div class="i0">With a trumpet-sounding wind, or a stirring hurricane;</div>
  <div class="i0">It did not rattle 'gainst the glass a lively, merry chime,</div>
  <div class="i0">But a dull and dreary drizzle, a stupid, yawning time.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">I almost had a mind to venture on the street,</div>

  <div class="i0">It struck me that some pleasant chat would restore a cheerful tone,</div>

  <div class="i0">But scarcely had I entered, ere there fell, distinct and clear,</div>
  <div class="i0">The sound of <em>cutting pages</em> upon my wondering ear;</div>

  <div class="i0">I would not have accepted; but I love the first, fresh look.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">So I waited very patiently, and my reward was near;</div>
  <div class="i0">I saw that he was pleased, though it cost me rather dear;</div>
  <div class="i0">And when the day was closing, and the rain at last was done,</div>
  <div class="i0">I enjoyed the precious "Godey," and the glorious setting sun.</div>

<h3>WORK-TABLE FOR JUVENILES;</h3>

<p class="center"><b>OR,</b></p>

<p class="p5">LITTLE MARY'S HALF-HOLIDAY.</p>

<p>"W<span class="smcapa">ELL</span>, my dear, I am glad to see you ready
for work again."</p>

<p>"Here are six yards of pink satin ribbon,
about an inch wide, some pink sarsnet, some
card-board, black net, and plaited straw. What
kind of straw is it, mamma?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mtop1 illowe30" src="images/i_455.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>BACK OF A WATCH-POCKET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It is called straw-beading, and is employed
in the same way that split straw was once used;
but as it is flexible, and to be had in any length,
it is much more easily worked. Besides the
things you have mentioned, there is some pink
sewing silk, and a little stiff muslin. Now you
have all your materials complete, and I have
only to show you how to use them. Begin by
cutting out the shape for the back of the watch-pocket.
Here is a drawing of it. It is 7 inches
long, and 4½ in the widest part. Mark the depth
of three inches from the bottom, and form this
into a half round, then cut it into a point from
the widest part to the top. The lower part,
which is for the pocket, is thus three inches
deep, and the top four inches. You will require
two pieces of card-board of this shape and size,
which must be covered on both sides with pink
silk. Tack them together round the edges."</p>

<p>"These pieces are for the backs. Are the
fronts of the pockets made of card-board, too?"</p>

<p>"No; you will use the stiff muslin for them.
They must be in the half circle form, 3 inches
deep, but 5½ inches wide at the top. They must
also be covered with silk on both sides. Now
cut out two pieces of black net, rather larger
than the backs, and two more (also allowing for
turnings in) for the fronts. Do you remark
anything peculiar in the net?"</p>

<p>"It is like the imitation netting you brought
from Paris, mamma; is it not? The holes are
perfect diamonds, and much larger than in any
English net."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is part of that I brought with me.
Being so open, it is easy to slip the straw through
it. Take the end of the straw, pass it under two
threads, and over three, in one line. Cut it off
close to the edge of the net. Run in as many
lines as you can in the same direction, but with
intervals of four holes, five threads between
them. Cross them with others in the same way,
both straws passing under the <em>same</em> hole when
they cross. All the four pieces of net must be
worked in the same way, and then tacked on, to
cover the silk on one side. Now sew the fronts
to the backs. The ribbon trimming must now
be prepared. It is to be quilled in the centre,
in the way called <em>box</em> quilling; that is, one plait
must be to the right, and the next to the left.
Do enough for the top of each pocket separately,
and put it on, then a length to go completely
round. Finish each pocket with a knot of ribbon
at the point, and a small loop to pin it to the
bed."</p>

<p>"Do you know, mamma, I was inclined to
think you had not matched the sarsnet and ribbon
well? The sarsnet looked so much the darker.
Now they correspond perfectly. How is that?"</p>

<p>"You forget that the sarsnet is covered with
net, which softens the depth of the tint considerably.
Had the covering been muslin, it must
have been still deeper, to correspond with the
uncovered ribbon. It is for want of the consideration
of these small points that there is so
frequently a want of harmony in the tints of
amateur needlewomen."</p>

<p>"And now, mamma, what next? For I have a
good deal of spare time still."</p>

<p>"You said you would like to work papa a
pair of slippers, so I have contrived a design for
you, which will use up all your remnants of
wool. We will call it the dice pattern. Of each
color you may use, you will require two shades
with black and white. You can mark on your
canvas the outline of the slippers with a soft pen
and ink; then work from the drawing I have
made, beginning at the toe. You may use any
number of colors, only let them be well chosen,
and falling in stripes. Do not put green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
blue, or any other two colors which do not blend
well, close together. You may try the effect
with shades in the following order: violet,
orange, green, crimson, blue. That part which
is quite white in the drawing is done in white
wool, and there are two spotted squares which
are to be black. Then the upper side of each die
is in the darker shade of whatever color may be
used, and the under light. Fill it up with black.
If you work on Penelope canvas, you will find it
much easier."</p>

<h5>EMBROIDERY.&mdash;DRESS UNDERSLEEVE.</h5>

cotton, No. 100.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">RACE</span> the pattern upon the muslin with a
quill pen and blue mixed with gum-water;
make the leaves, stems, and flowers in raised
satin stitch; the circles in button-hole stitch,

preferred; if close, a raised spot must be worked
in the centre of each. Work the edge in button-hole
stitch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>EVANGELINE AND ANTOINETTE.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engravings on page <a href="#Page_385">385</a>.)</p>

<p>E<span class="smcapa">VANGELINE</span>.&mdash;Silk embroidered, and trimmed
with two rows of guipure lace&mdash;one row of
lace round the yoke, and one about ten inches
from the bottom, each row headed with a narrow
quilling of ribbon, which also goes down
the front and round the neck. On the yoke and
between the rows of lace there is handsome embroidery.</p>

<p>A<span class="smcapa">NTOINETTE.</span> <em>An entirely new pattern.</em>&mdash;The
mantilla is entirely formed of rows of lace or
pinked silk on a silk or thin foundation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>LACE MANTILLA AND TABLET MANTILLA.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engravings on page <a href="#Page_388">388</a>.)</p>

<p>L<span class="smcapa">ACE</span> M<span class="smcapa">ANTILLA</span>.&mdash;This mantilla has three
capes&mdash;the first is in depth twenty-three inches,
the second eighteen inches, and the third fourteen
inches, with lace edging to match. The
collar is six inches in depth, with a bow of ribbon
behind.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">ABLET</span> M<span class="smcapa">ANTILLA</span>.&mdash;<em>Material.</em> Watered or
plain silk. It is made with a yoke, and falls
low on the shoulders. For trimming, it is cut
in turrets, trimmed with narrow braid and netted
fringe sewed underneath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>MARQUISE AND NAVAILLES.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engravings on page <a href="#Page_389">389</a>.)</p>

<p>M<span class="smcapa">ARQUISE</span>.&mdash;<em>Silk Pelisse.</em> The body is
close; it is trimmed with three rows of goffered
ribbons disposed in arcades, and terminated at
each point by loops of ribbons one over the other.
A row of ribbons runs round the bottom of the
body, which has also a lace trimming that falls
over the opening of the sleeve. The skirt falls
in flutes; it has three rows of ribbons and a lace
flounce.</p>

<p>N<span class="smcapa">AVAILLES</span>.&mdash;<em>Shawl-Mantelet</em>, of taffetas
trimmed with lace, fringe, and silk ribbons having
velvet stripes. It opens like a shawl in front,
and comes high behind. A lace of two inches
in width turns down on the neck as far as the
bow on the breast; a point falls behind like a
little shawl, and is bordered with a ribbon sewed
on flat, and a lace of about five inches, besides a
fringe; in front this lace forms a bertha. The
lower part of the garment, sewed on under the
point, is rounded, and hangs in flutes behind. It
is bordered with the same ribbon, accompanied
by the same, and fringe. The ends in front are
pointed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>SPRING FASHIONS.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engraving on page <a href="#Page_390">390</a>.)</p>

<p>Fig. 1. <em>Dress.</em>&mdash;Skirt of steel-colored gray silk,
without any trimming. Sachet of black velvet;
the front opening to a point, and the basque
rounded and edged with a deep fall of black lace
set on rather full. The sleeves, which are demi-long
and loose at the ends, are likewise edged
with lace chemisette and undersleeves of worked
muslin. A round cap of Honiton lace, the front
edged with pointed vandykes. The cap is ornamented
at each side with bows of ribbon having
long flowing ends, edged with fringe. The ribbon
has a white ground, and is figured with a
pattern similar to that called the Victoria plaid.
The bows are intermingled with bouquets of white
roses. Hair bracelets, with snaps of gold and
turquoise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fig. 2. <em>Little Girl's Dress.</em>&mdash;Frock of dark blue
glacé; the skirts ornamented with four narrow
ruches of ribbon, placed two and two together.
The corsage is in the jacket style, half high in
the neck, and fitting closely to the form. The
basque is edged with a double ruche of ribbon,
which is carried up the front and round the top
of the corsage. The sleeves just descend below
the turn of the elbow, and are trimmed at the end
with ribbon ruche. The undersleeves are of
jaconet muslin, drawn in a full puff, confined
at the wrists by bands of needlework insertion.
The chemisette is high to the throat, and is
formed of two rows of drawn muslin, divided by
a row of needlework insertion, and finished at
top by a row of the same. Short trousers of
white cambric muslin edged with a bordering of
needlework. The front hair banded on each side
of the forehead; the back hair plaited, and the
plaits turned up and fastened by rows of black
velvet ribbon, two bands of which are passed
across the forepart of the head.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fig. 3. <em>Promenade, or Carriage Dress.</em>&mdash;Robe
of brown gros de naples. The skirt is trimmed
with ten rows of black velvet, of graduated
width. The corsage is low, square in front, and
partly open; the opening being confined by bands
of black velvet. The corsage has a basque at the
waist, cut out in castellated ends which are
edged with velvet. The sleeves are slit open to
the height of the shoulder, and the opening is confined
by bands of velvet, like those in front of the
corsage. The chemisette is of worked muslin,
and trimmed with Valenciennes lace. Undersleeves
to correspond. Bonnet of white silk, ornamented
with vine leaves and blonde. Undertrimming,
a wreath of flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR A LETTER-BAND.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engraving on page <a href="#Page_391">391</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Materials.</em>&mdash;One yard and a half of sarsnet ribbon, two
inches in width, and of any color preferred; one bunch of
steel beads, No. 5; some sewing silk of the same color as
the ribbon, and some perforated cardboard one row narrower
than the ribbon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark the letters and border with the beads on
the cardboard, which should be about four inches
long; also a piece about two inches square,
worked with beads in any ornamental pattern;
fasten the longest piece of cardboard to the ribbon
in the centre, stitching it at both edges, then
sew the smaller piece about two inches nearer
the end of the ribbon; sew a piece of the same
ribbon under this small piece of cardboard at
each end&mdash;this forms a loop for the ribbon to
pass through. This completes the band.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>THE ALBUERA.</h3>

<p class="center">(See engraving on page <a href="#Page_392">392</a>.)</p>

<p>This mantilla is one of great beauty. It is
made of blue glacé silk, but can be in any choice
color. Lavender and lustrous pearl and mode
colors look especially well, as also the greens,
in this garment. Its chief peculiarity consists
in its square front and its fitting so as to just
cut the edge of the shoulder. It is fastened at
the top by a bow; the back falls with an easy
fulness; it is embroidered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR KNITTING A WORK-BASKET.</h3>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">AKE</span> four needles, cast three stitches on
each, knit plain round once; put thread over
needle; knit once so all round. Then plain
once round. Continue this process till there
are five stitches between the times of widening.
Plain round once; widen, knit four narrow so
all round; plain round; widen, knit one, widen,
knit three narrow so all round, plain round,
widen, knit three, widen, knit two, narrow so
all round, plain round, widen, knit five, widen,
knit one, narrow so all round, plain round, widen,
knit seven, widen, knit one, narrow so all round,
plain round three times. Turn the basket inside
out, knit three times round plain, put thread
over needle and seam two in one all round, then
twice plain. Continue this till you have six
rows of eyelets, then two plain, three seamed,
four plain. Then make one row of eyelets,
knit three rows plain, hem down. Then your
basket is done.</p>

<p>H<span class="smcapa">OW TO</span> F<span class="smcapa">ORM IT</span>.&mdash;Prepare a solution of
glue, dip your basket into it when it is <em>very wet</em>,
wring it out, have your form ready to put it on,
where it must lie for a day or two. Then you
can paint it any color you like. The block on
which it is put to dry can be round or not, as
you prefer. If you wish a large one, cast on
more stitches when you begin. Four on a needle
makes a large size.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>I<span class="smcapa">N</span> accordance with the popular fashion of the
day, we "open," in the present article, a group
of the most tasteful bonnets of the season. We
give them not only that our lady readers may
see what is worn, but as models for their own
fair fingers. Is it known to them that bonnet-making
is now quite a fashion among those skilful
in fancy-work, the most sensible branch we
have seen adopted for many years? Why should
not the taste and ingenuity exercised in lamp-mats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
of old, and crochet tidies of the present
day, be as well displayed in the light and graceful
task of millinery? The neatness and patience
required in covering the card-board of an
ingenious needle-book can be more fully exercised
in disposing the folds of silk and lace on
the well-shaped frame easily procured for a
trifle.</p>

<p>The peculiar trait of the hats of the present
season is the great quantity of mixed materials,
as crape, silk, lace, flowers, and ribbon, on one
very small structure. Great taste is to be exercised
in mingling these judiciously&mdash;ornamenting,
not overloading; in the first place, selecting
a good model as to shape and style.</p>

<p>No. 1 we have chosen for its simplicity. It is
composed of three rows of pink crape or silk,
drawn in a puffing, with a blonde edging rather
wide on each. The crown is entirely of lace,
and there is a fall of the same on the cape. A
knot of pink satin bows, to the right, is all the
decoration of the exterior. A full cap of blonde,
with one or two pink bows, carelessly disposed,
inside the brim.</p>

<p>No. 2 shows the extreme of the shallow brim,
and two-thirds of the wearer's head at the same
time. It is, notwithstanding, a neat and modest-looking
dress bonnet of pomona green silk, the
crown piece, which is in full flutings, extending
almost to the edge of the brim. This is crossed
by a band of the same with bound edges (old
style). The front is a very full double <em>ruche</em> of
blonde, between the two green silk cordings.
A full cap of the same fills the space between
the face and the brim, with a spray of flowers
set very high to the right.</p>

<p>No. 3.&mdash;A more elaborate hat of straw-colored
silk and white guipure lace. It has a small
plume on the left, and has a full spray of bridal
roses inside the brim.</p>

<p>No. 4 shows the disposition of lace and bow
at the back of a crown, a great point in the millinery
of the present season; a stiff crown will
ruin a graceful brim.</p>

<h2><a name="PLAIN_WORK" id="PLAIN_WORK"></a>PLAIN WORK.</h2>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> often find our correspondents writing,
"Are there any new patterns for underclothes?"
"Can you send me a good night-cap pattern?"
etc. etc. This has suggested to us the plan of
publishing designs for plain as well as ornamental
needlework, and we commence the present
month by two selected from the large establishment
of Madame Demorest, late of Canal
Street, now of 375 Broadway, New York. Besides
the infinite variety of outer garments, children's
clothing, etc., to which we have before
alluded, Madame Demorest has patterns of everything
for a lady's under wardrobe, in sets or
singly, so arranged as to look exactly like the
garment itself; and, as they can be sent by mail,
there is thus an end to the necessity of begging
and borrowing in every direction through a
country neighborhood.</p>

<p>An article of practical instructions in the art
of plain-sewing, for it is, indeed, an art, will be
given from time to time. It is a great pity that
this knowledge has, in most cases, to be acquired
by the married woman. We think it should be
considered an essential part of the education of
the daughter. All the pages of instruction that
may be written or read upon the subject, can
never give that aptitude and ease in the performance
of this very necessary household duty,
which would be acquired by seeing how others
do it, and being taught while young to take a
part in the operation. A young mother who is
not a dressmaker or seamstress by profession,
but who can quietly cut out and make any article
of dress that may be wanted, is looked upon
by her companions as a sort of marvellous prodigy.
"Oh, how can you do it?" "Well, I
never had any genius that way!" are their exclamations.
And why have they no genius that
way? In most cases, it is simply because they
have been taught at some "seminary for young
ladies" to despise such employments as mean
and vulgar. Those who have genius enough to
knit fancy patterns, or work bunches of flowers
upon canvas, are quite capable of learning how
to employ their needle for useful household purposes.
But express a wish to those who by profession
undertake the education of girls, that
your children should learn to employ the needle
usefully, and you will most likely be told, "Oh,
we really have not time to attend to that; there
is so much else that must be learned, we cannot
undertake plain needlework." And what does
all that is learned tend to? Frequently, to little
more than a smattering of this and that, by
which the learner hopes to gain admiration, and
eventually a husband. Even the few years that
are sometimes spent at home, between school-days
and marriage, are wasted in visiting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
frivolity and gaining a husband. How to fulfil
those duties which such an acquisition brings
upon her, seems to be a problem which may be
answered by the assertion, "Sufficient to the
day is the evil thereof." In many respects,
those children who are taught in public schools
are really better educated for domestic life than
the children of the classes a rank or two higher,
who are brought up in boarding-schools or day
schools for young ladies. However, pages and
volumes might usefully be written on the inappropriate
mode of bringing up the daughters of
families, who have nothing or little beside their
own exertions to look to for their maintenance;
but this is not our present object. Many there
are who would willingly exchange the frivolities
learned at school for a knowledge how to make
out and plan the clothes of their families; and,
for the benefit of such, we will endeavor, as far
as paper and print can do it, to teach them.</p>

<p>The present models are&mdash;</p>

<p>Fig. 1.&mdash;A night-dress with plaited front and
full sleeves, an extremely neat and excellent
pattern, designed and furnished by Madame Demorest.
The back may be either full in a yoke,
or of a sacque form.</p>

<p>Fig. 2 is also one of Madame Demorest's designs,
a chemise, plaited front, and highly ornamented
yoke, as is the present style. The embroidery
is with linen floss, and will wear as
long as the garment, a great matter in trimming.
The shape combines neatness and ease, and will
be found extremely comfortable.</p>

<h2><a name="EDITORS_TABLE" id="EDITORS_TABLE"><img class="illowe30" src="images/i_462.jpg" alt="EDITORS TABLE" /></a></h2>


<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> have before us several letters from writers of influence
and high consideration in different sections of our
country, making inquiries respecting the progress of Female
Medical Education. We cannot refuse these earnest
appeals for information, and, as we trust our myriad
readers will feel an interest more or less in the subject,
we shall give the response to all who gather around our
Table.</p>

<p>The third annual commencement of the Female Medical
College of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, was held
on the 25th of February last, when the Degree of Doctor of
Medicine was conferred by the President, Charles D. Cleveland,
on four ladies&mdash;Elizabeth H. Bates, New York; Lucinda
R. Brown, Texas; Minna Elliger, Germany; and
Elizabeth G. Shattuck, Pennsylvania&mdash;the latter belonging
to the Medical Missionary <em>protégées</em> preparing to go out to
China or India, as opportunity may offer. The number of
students in this college during the past session was about
thirty, and the applications for admittance to the privileges
of the institution for the next session, commencing
October 2, are already numerous and earnest.</p>

<p>There is only <em>one</em> obstacle, viz., <em>the want of funds</em>. Those
young women and widows wishing to enter on this study
are, usually, poor. The expenses for board and books are
all they can meet. If the college were endowed, so that
the tuition fees for all might be reduced to the lowest sum<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
named for beneficiaries, while these last were admitted <em>free</em>
of college charges, the school would be crowded. Are there
none among the rich of this city and State who will lend a
helping hand to this noble work of qualifying women to
become physicians for their own sex? <em>Fifty thousand</em> dollars
invested, so that the interest could be annually applied
for the benefit of the institution, would be sufficient.
There would thus be open a way by which those women
who have talents for the profession might enter on the
study. What a blessing this would be to them and to society!
The sufferings which delicacy imposes on the sex,
while compelled to submit their complaints to the knowledge
of the male physician only, are shocking, and often
fatal&mdash;because concealment leads to death. Such a state
of ignorance in regard to all that pertains to the preservation
of health and cure of diseases should no longer be
permitted to prevail among those who have the direct and
sole care of infancy, and are the nurses and watchers by
the sick. The good results of educating women for the
profession are thus truly set forth in the interesting "Valedictory
Address," by Dr. Elwood Harvey, one of the Faculty
of the Female Medical College:&mdash;</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>W<span class="smcapa">HAT</span> F<span class="smcapa">EMALE</span> P<span class="smcapa">HYSICIANS CAN DO</span>.&mdash;"No intelligent person
doubts that, if we were <em>obedient</em> to the laws of health, so far
as they are now understood, sickness and suffering would
be greatly diminished. The average of human life would
be prolonged, and its usefulness and happiness increased.
In the earliest ages of which we have any recorded history,
rules for the preservation of health, and regulations for
the prevention of diseases, constitute a conspicuous part
of the legal code."</p>

<p class="center">* <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span> <span class="mleft4">*</span></p>

<p>"In this country, where the people govern themselves,
it is the people that must be enlightened, that they may
govern themselves wisely. Though there is not a more
law-abiding nation on the earth, we are blessed in having
but few laws to be obeyed. There is a larger individual
liberty here than elsewhere, and consequently a greater individual
responsibility. It is to the <em>people</em>, then, that you
are to convey a knowledge of the laws that govern their
being. You have ample scope for usefulness in this capacity.
In your own sex, you will find wives and mothers,
ignorant of their own constitutions, bringing wretchedness
and misery upon themselves, discomfort and suffering upon
their families, and, worse than all, entailing enfeebled constitutions
and diseases upon their offspring. To enlighten
these, to teach them the duty they owe to themselves, to
their families, to society, to posterity, and to Him who
created them, and instituted the laws they violate, is your
peculiar province. Do this, and the world will owe you a
debt it can never repay&mdash;but you will have your reward."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">EMALE</span> P<span class="smcapa">HYSICIANS</span> W<span class="smcapa">ANTED</span>.&mdash;"Some of the obstacles
that oppose the entrance of the young practitioner to a remunerative
practice will offer less than their usual amount
of resistance to you. It commonly happens that the young
physician has to wait long years of probation, during which
much work has to be done for small pay before he begins
to reap the full reward of his labors. Not only is it necessary
for him to acquire a reputation for skill and attention
to business, but a respectable age must be attained before
he can hope to be employed in some of the most profitable
departments of practice. With you the case is very different;
there is an existing demand for your services which
none others can so well supply. Each city in this country
is ready to give employment to a large number of female
physicians, each lesser town and country village is waiting
for one or more; numerous applications from various parts
of the country have been made for female physicians. At
a moderate computation, we may estimate the number
now in actual demand in this country at not less than five
thousand. You are wanted for a kind of practice that most
male physicians would gladly relinquish to you, whenever
they are convinced that you have been regularly educated,
and are competent to perform the duties of the position
you have assumed."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>W<span class="smcapa">HILE</span> on this subject, we will give here an original article,
written for our "Book" by a professor in another institution,<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
which shows that this liberal feeling towards</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p>female practitioners is fast gaining public favor in this
city:&mdash;</p>

<p>L<span class="smcapa">ADIES</span>' M<span class="smcapa">EDICAL</span> E<span class="smcapa">DUCATION</span>.&mdash;That it would be very useful
and conducive to the health and happiness of families, if
the mothers of families, and women in general, were familiar
with the principal doctrines of anatomy, physiology,
and pathology, so as to understand, to some degree, the
organization, functions, and diseases of the human system,
there cannot be any doubt. But whether it be in accordance
with the natural position of woman in society to take
upon herself the office, labors, and responsibilities of a physician
is another question, which need not here be decided.
So much, however, may be said with propriety,
without at all deciding the question alluded to, that such
ladies as are desirous of obtaining a full medical education,
and devoting themselves to the study of the medical sciences
in good earnest, ought not to be refused such an education,
but have as much chance given to them as the other sex
enjoy. For, however we may disagree respecting the propriety
of woman practising medicine as a profession, certainly
her <em>knowledge</em> of medicine cannot be detrimental to
the good of society. If a more general diffusion of medical
knowledge among the ladies had no other effect than to
enforce a higher standard of education among the physicians
on one side, and to annihilate the greatest bane of
ignorance, quackery, on the other side, this alone would be
a sufficient reason for spreading "more light" among the
ladies, though it be "medical."</p>

<p>We cannot, therefore, see any harm in the establishment
of female medical schools, but would suggest the propriety
of organizing them in such a manner that their teachings
should not be confined to the comparatively few ladies who
enter them for a full medical education; but also be made
accessible to the generality of ladies, especially young ladies,
who do not want a "professional" education in medicine,
but who would study some branches, such as anatomy,
physiology, pathology, and perhaps chemistry, natural
philosophy, and botany, with much delight and profit,
without asking for a diploma, but to carry the delightful
satisfaction with them that they possess that which may
save themselves and others around them untold disease
and suffering, and protect them against all sorts of knavery
and quackery, not to speak of the accomplishments and
intellectual joys such studies are apt to give to ladies.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A <span class="smcapa">VERY SENSIBLE</span> D<span class="smcapa">OCTOR</span>.&mdash;Dr. J. Wilson, of Alabama,
proposes, in the <em>Southern Medical Journal</em>, that female
classes be formed in our medical colleges for instruction in
anatomy&mdash;excluding the surgical and pathological&mdash;human
physiology, medical chemistry, materia medica, and
all female diseases. We hope those who have the direction
of medical education will act on this hint. Why should
woman be excluded from the study of medicine? She is
the Heaven-appointed guardian of the sick and of helpless
infancy; she should know how to preserve health and how
to restore it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> P<span class="smcapa">RACTICAL</span>.&mdash;We have lately met with a rather
astounding and extremely practical proposition, well suited
to the genius of our nation. We, the mightiest people on
the face of the globe, will not allow our scenery to remain
scenery without some Barnum-like investment upon it.
We do not intend that our natural curiosities shall continue
natural. Jonathan must make his playthings useful,
else he may as well fling them behind him. The Falls
of Niagara have been too long exempt from the common
lot; it is time they should be trained to propriety and productiveness.
No doubt it is extremely fine to see them
wandering at their own wild will, plunging madly down
the precipice; but will any one pretend to say that in all
this there is anything practical? The fact is, Niagara is
of no use to us, and we can no longer tolerate her as a
drone; she must be forced to work. Let her be made the
motive power of numberless mills and manufactories.
Thus would be secured a noble union of Nature and Art!
How much more manly and suggestive than the common
rhymes addressed to her grandeur and magnificence would
be some such invocation as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">Oh, thou that grindest buckwheat on thy way,</div>
  <div class="i1">Free and unfettered on thy watery wing,</div>
  <div class="i0">Creation's wonder! How much corn a day</div>
  <div class="i1">Doth thy sublimity to flour bring?</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>We wonder what our nation would do with Mont Blanc
if they had it? Place an ice-cream freezing establishment
on its summit, perhaps; or tunnel it, <em>à la</em> Thames, and
settle a Yankee colony within. We shall next expect to
hear that Mammoth Cave has been partitioned off into
comfortable apartments, to let to small families. Rooms
containing stalactites extra charge, as in such cases clothes-pins
would be unnecessary.</p>

<p>Imperial Rome folds her mantle grandly around her, and
sits in magnificent sadness at the base of her broken statues
and fallen temples&mdash;Niobe weeping for her children.
Young America strides along in broadcloth and beaver,
and only sees that the statue might have been a mantle-piece,
or the temple a machine-shop. He forgets whence
the money-changers and sellers of doves were driven, because
they made the Father's house a house of merchandise.
He does not see that stars burn brighter than patent
oil, or that earth was intended for another purpose
than a plantation. He is more eager to manufacture the
napkin than to improve the talent within it. His life is
practical; his body is practical; his soul is practical. He
would make death and eternity practical, if he only knew
how to do it.</p>

<p>Oh, Niagara! are the clanking of machinery and the noise
of the water-wheel to be thy dirge? Shall a saw-mill be
located on Goat Island, or a stove-foundry near Table
Rock? Shall thy rainbow span the summit of a comb
manufactory, or thy spray fall silvery on a button establishment?
Shall we bewail thy beauty and grandeur
forever, as we cry, "Niagara has fallen&mdash;has fallen into a
mill-dam!"</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>H<span class="smcapa">ERE</span> is a prose sketch on the same ever-fertile subject,
the writer modestly styling her collection, "<em>Shells from the
Shore of Thought:</em>"&mdash;</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">PRING</span>.&mdash;Would that thoughts on Spring would spring
up in my mind radiant as the gentle flowers which the
clarion voice of Spring awakens from their wintry slumber!
Would that I could array these thoughts in eloquence as
glorious as the vesture which she gives the lovely flowers!</p>

<p>She casts around them a mantle of vivid green, lifts
their modest heads beneath a pearly veil of mist, and
crowns them with a diadem of dew-drops, which the morning
sunlight transmutes to amethysts and rubies, emeralds
and diamonds.</p>

<p>But, sad to say, my thoughts are less like the flowers,
and more like the seed of that tribe (thistle, &amp;c.) which
float through the air on a silken sail in quest of a place of
repose. Some find them bright homes in lands far away,
like the thoughts of the gifted, which become household
words; but others, the silk of whose sail is not fine, float
adrift on the waves, to be lost, like my thoughts, in the
ocean of years.</p>

<p>Spring is the symbol of the resurrection; flowers, of the
human race. In the autumn of life, man falls asleep like
the flowers; but the icy reign of the winter of death is
broken by the glorious springtide of immortality, where
the circling seasons are no more, where there is neither
death nor tears.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>M<span class="smcapa">EMORY</span>.&mdash;Pleasure paints the Present, Memory paints
the Past, Hope paints the Future, and spans its shadowy
portals with an arch of light, radiant as the sunbow o'er
the cataract. Memory tortures the wicked and consoles
the righteous. When the sunlight of Hope wanes away
from the landscape of life, then the moonlight of Memory
its shadowy lustre sheds o'er the scene. Memory&mdash;a stereotyped
edition of the Past. Memory&mdash;as the moonlight
is to sunlight, so is Memory unto Hope.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>M<span class="smcapa">USIC</span>.&mdash;Sacred music&mdash;that which on earth wakes an
echo in heaven. Music, the soother of the sorrowing.
Music, the praises of One who loves us; notes which dwell
in the heart, like the lingering perfume of withering violets,
when the voice which created the beautiful music is
silent forever on earth.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>L<span class="smcapa">OVE</span>.&mdash;Life is a tangled web, but through its woof there
runs the golden thread of Love.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>P<span class="smcapa">HILADELPHIA</span> H<span class="smcapa">IGH</span> S<span class="smcapa">CHOOL FOR</span> G<span class="smcapa">IRLS</span>.&mdash;When is this institution
to be opened? <em>The High School for Boys</em> has been
sustained in the most liberal manner many years, and
now a new and costly edifice for the school is nearly prepared.
Will not the men of Philadelphia add beauty as
well as strength to the recent act of "Consolidation," by
founding a H<span class="smcapa">IGH</span> S<span class="smcapa">CHOOL FOR</span> G<span class="smcapa">IRLS</span>?</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A G<span class="smcapa">REAT</span> D<span class="smcapa">UTY WHICH IS</span> I<span class="smcapa">MPOSED UPON</span> M<span class="smcapa">OTHERS</span>.&mdash;Listen,
good mothers: this is not a question of one of those idle
studies, the only aim of which is to stock the memory; it
concerns an important question, the most important which
can be agitated on the earth; so important, that the manner
in which you resolve it will decide, without appeal of
your moral life and death, of the moral life and death of
your children. It is not only a matter that regards yourselves,
but also the flesh of your flesh, the blood of your
blood; those poor little creatures, whom you have brought
into this world, with passions, vices, love, hatred, pain, and
death; for these are, in truth, what they have received
from you with the life of the body; and these will, indeed,
be miserable presents, if you do not also give them the life
of the soul; that is to say, arms wherewith to fight, and a
light whereby to direct themselves.</p>

<p>You are mothers according to the laws of our material
nature, with all the love of a hen which watches over its
little ones, and covers them with its wings. I come to ask
you to be mothers according to the laws of our divine nature,
with all the love of a soul called upon to form souls.</p>

<p>Assure yourselves well whether or not you owe to your
children only the milk of your breasts, and the instruction
of the intelligence; and if you interrogate the Gospel and
nature, take heed to their answer&mdash;"Man does not live by
bread alone, but by the word of truth."</p>

<p>Truth is that which renders man free; it is the voice
which calls us to the love of God and of our neighbor, and
to virtue.</p>

<p>Error, on the contrary, is that which renders us slaves
to the passions of others and to our own; it is that which
causes us to sacrifice our conscience to fortune, to honors,
to glory, to vice.</p>

<p>Thus, virtue springs from truth; crime from error;
whence we may infer that a good treatise on education can
only be in the end the search after truth.</p>

<p>The destiny of your children depends then on the solicitude
with which you engage in this search. You may
open out to them the road to happiness, and precede them
in it. A delightful task, which calls for all the powers of
your soul, and which will place you in the presence of God,
of nature, of your children, and of yourselves.</p>

<p>And mark well all that nature has done towards accomplishing
this difficult work. In the first place, she has
brought you near to the truth which is in her, by detaching
your sex from almost all the ambitions which debase
our own; and secondly, she has given your love to the
tenderness of little children, at the same time that she has
filled their hearts with innocence, and their minds with
curiosity. Can you doubt the object of your mission, when
you perceive the sweet harmonies which unite them to
you? Nature attaches them to your bosoms, awakens
them by your caresses; she wills that they should owe
everything to you, so that, after having received from you
life and thought, these earthly angels await your inspirations,
in order to believe and to love.&mdash;<em>L. Aimé Martin.</em></p>

not been examined; will be reported next month.</p>

<p>The following are declined, many of them because we

<p>THE U. S. GRINNELL EXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF
SIR JOHN FRANKLIN. <em>A Personal Narrative.</em> By Elisha
Kent Kane, M. D., U. S. N. As Americans, we certainly
have reason to feel, and may therefore be permitted
to express an honest pride and gratification in the rapid
contributions which our countrymen are continually presenting
to the various departments of literature and science.
Among the more recent and most valuable of these
and similar contributions is the beautiful volume the title
of which stands at the head of this article. In 1850, Mr.
Grinnell, an eminent merchant of New York, actuated by
a most humane and liberal spirit, fitted out two of his own
vessels and proffered them gratuitously to the government
to be employed in an expedition to the Arctic region, in
search of Sir John Franklin, who had not been heard from
after the 26th of July, 1850. The officers of this expedition
were appointed by the navy department. It was commanded
by Lieut. Edwin J. De Haven, and its first surgeon
was Dr. E. K. Kane, who, at the request of the commander,
became the historian of their perilous and romantic
voyage. We say romantic, because the scenes to which
we are introduced by the graphic pen of the doctor seem
more like the creations of the imagination than the realities
of sober observation, or the experience of personal adventure.
In addition to the historical, scientific, and descriptive
merits of the work, it is profusely and beautifully
illustrated by fine mezzotints and wood-engravings.</p>

Streets, Philadelphia:&mdash;</p>

<p>BOYS AT HOME. By C. Adams, author of "Edward
Clifton," etc. Illustrated by John Gilbert. This is an
English story, written especially for the moral instruction
and encouragement of young persons in adverse circumstances.
It inculcates the highest principles of duty and
honor, and, at the same time, shows the necessity of perseverance
in the accomplishment of virtuous designs.</p>

<p>THE CHEMISTRY OF COMMON LIFE. By James F.
W. Johnson. It should be read by the million, for it informs
us all about the air we breathe, the water we drink,
the soil we cultivate, and the plant we rear. The dedication
is to Sir David Brewster, one of the most eminent scientific
men in England. We shall make some extracts
from the work for our June number.</p>

<p>THE SUNSHINE OF GREYSTONE. <em>A Story for Girls.</em>
By E. J. May, author of "Louis's Schoolboy Days." This is
a handsome volume, with many beautiful illustrations.
Its greatest beauties, however, will be found in the good
sense, the high moral tone, and in the pure religious feeling
which pervade its printed pages.</p>

<p>THEOLOGICAL ESSAYS. By Frederick Dinison Maurice,
M. A., Chaplain of Lincoln's Inn. From the second
London edition. With a new preface and other additions.
The author of this work is a learned clergyman of the Established
Church of England. The volume contains seventeen
essays on subjects intimately connected with the dogma
of that church, and explanatory of the general teachings
of Christianity. These essays were originally a series
of discourses delivered before the author's own congregation,
and embraced numerous topics which he desired to
bring under the notice of Unitarians. They therefore partake
of a controversial spirit, but in a mild and charitable
form.</p>

<p>THE WORKINGMAN'S WAY IN THE WORLD. <em>Being
the Autobiography of a Journeyman Printer.</em> This volume
furnishes us with what purports to be the true, and certainly
is the very interesting history of the struggles of an
English journeyman printer.</p>

<p>CLASSIC AND HISTORIC PORTRAITS. By James
Bruce. This volume is devoted to a description of the personal
appearance of a long list of celebrated persons, male
and female, ancient and modern, commencing with Sappho,
and ending with Madame de Stael. The peculiarities
of character, which accompany the "descriptive list," render
this volume interesting and instructive in a high degree.</p>

<p>LETTERS TO A YOUNG MAN, AND OTHER PAPERS.
By Thomas De Quincey, author of "Confessions of an English
Opium-Eater," etc. etc. Exclusive of the "Letters,"
five in number, this volume contains seven essays: 1.
Theory of Greek Tragedy; 2. Conversation; 3. Language;
4. French and English Language; 5. California and the
Gold Mania; 6. Ceylon; 7. Presence of Mind; in all which
the great reputation of the author as an instructive and
philosophical writer is fully sustained.</p>

<p>SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS OF HIS EXCELLENCY,
JOHN BIGLER, <em>Governor of the State of California</em>.
Such is the title of a pamphlet sent us from the press
of George Kerr, State Printer, Benicia, and the address is
worthy of being thus distributed over the whole country.
It is a clear and able exposition of the progress and resources
of that wonderful portion of our Union. Aladdin,
with his genii, could hardly have effected greater changes
than gold and the genius of American freedom have effected
in California. We are much obliged to the friend who
sent us this excellent address. The name of Bigler should
be highly honored in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>WESTERN DEMOCRATIC REVIEW. George P. Buell,
Editor and Publisher: Indianapolis, Jan., 1854. This is a
new periodical, whose table of contents embraces a variety
of subjects, social, political, poetical, biographical, and miscellaneous.
We welcome every such manifestation of the
growth, the prosperity, and the mental vigor of the Great
West. The editor is evidently a man of ability and enterprise,
and his articles, varied as they are, are all written
with spirit, and show a truly liberal and patriotic mind.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>THE SOUTHERN QUARTERLY REVIEW. C. Mortimer,
Publisher: Charleston, S. C. We have often wondered
that, excepting in political matters, the South has
so long been willing to do without a literature of its own.
We are glad to see that, at last, a publication devoted to
subjects of general interest, as well as to politics, seems to
meet with the success it deserves. The articles in it are
written evidently with care and thought, and, although
generally of too abstruse a nature to interest ladies, there
are one or two lighter articles, pleasant chronicles of the
olden time, which can hardly fail to please. Rich as South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
Carolina is in such themes, both from its old Huguenot
ancestry, and from the characteristic earnestness with
which it threw itself into the Revolutionary struggle, it
needs only some one with the patient and devoted spirit
of the antiquary to rescue from oblivion many scenes and
incidents of romantic interest. The political articles, exclusively
Southern as they are in thought and sentiment,
yet, by their earnestness and acumen, justify the boast
that the South is the birth-place of politicians.</p>

<p>THE PLANTER'S NORTHERN BRIDE. <em>A Novel.</em> By
Caroline Lee Hentz, author of "Linda," "Rena," "Eoline,"
etc. etc. We have not had time to become acquainted with
the true character of this novel. We have read sufficient,
however, to enable us to say that it is an effort to reconcile
the difficulties that are sometimes supposed to exist between
"true" lovers on account of their geographical positions.
The name of the popular author will be the best
recommendation we could give of her work. The volumes
sent us are of the cheap edition, with paper covers, price
fifty cents each. We are told that an edition is published
with six engravings, two volumes, cloth gilt, $1 50. We
might have been enabled to speak more confidently of the
merits of the work, had we been favored with the plates.</p>

<p>CORINNE; OR, ITALY. By Madame de Staël. Translated
by Isabel Hill; with metrical versions of the odes by
L. E. Landon. This is a new and very beautifully printed
edition of a work which, from its earliest publication, has
continued to be read, admired, and criticised by persons of
literary taste and judgment in all the languages of civilized
Europe. It cannot fail therefore to prove highly interesting
to that portion of our readers who may not have
had an opportunity of perusing it in the original French
of the celebrated author.</p>

<p>VATHEK: <em>an Arabian Tale</em>. By William Beckford, Esq.
With a memoir of the author, and notes critical and explanatory.
"Vathek" is an Eastern tale, written before
the author had attained his twentieth year, and was composed
at a single sitting of three days and two nights. For
more than seventy years it has held the highest rank
among similar works of imagination. It was a great
favorite with Byron, who preferred it even to "Rasselas."
In its descriptions of oriental costumes and of the manners
of the people, its correctness has been established by writers
of judgment, and, for "exquisite humor and supernatural
interest and grandeur," is declared to stand without a rival
in romance.</p>

<p>From John P. Jewett &amp; Co., Boston, and Jewett, Proctor,

Desilver, &amp; Butler, Philadelphia: "The Lamplighter."
This is a tale of unusual interest, written in a clear, natural
style.</p>

<p>From Ticknor, Reed, &amp; Fields, Boston: "The Barclays

<p>From D. Appleton &amp; Co., 200 Broadway, New York,
through C. G. Henderson &amp; Co., Philadelphia: "Marie
Louise; or, the Opposite Neighbors." By Emilie Carlen,
author of "John; or, Is a Cousin in hand worth two in the
Bush?" etc. Translated from the Swedish. The author of
this tale is deservedly popular, as well on account of the
beauty of her style, as because she is always endeavoring
to inculcate the purest morals.</p>

<p>From Blanchard &amp; Lea, Philadelphia: Nos. 1 and 2
"Orr's Circle of the Sciences." A series of treatises on
every branch of human knowledge. No. 1. On the Nature,
Connection, and Uses of the great departments of Human
Knowledge. By the Editor. No. 2. The Physiology of
Animal and Vegetable Life. By the Editor and Professor
Owen. With numerous illustrations. Price 15 cents.
These are the first numbers of a work now publishing in
London, designed to present in a popular style and condensed
space the leading facts and principles of the various
departments of human knowledge. The editors of this
valuable series are persons of the highest reputation.</p>

<p>From T. B. Peterson, 102 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia:
"Kate Clarendon; or, Necromancy in the Wilderness."
By Emerson Bennett. This is a very interesting and romantic
tale of the West, connected with the first settlements
on the Ohio River.&mdash;"Miriam Alroy." A Romance of
the Twelfth Century. By B. D'Israeli, M. P. Three English
volumes complete in one. Price 37 cents.</p>

<p>From Bunce &amp; Brothers, New York, through T. B. Peterson,
Philadelphia: "Carlington Castle: a Tale of the
Jesuits." By C. G. H., author of "The Curate of Linwood,"
etc. This is the story of an Irish heiress, who suffered a
fierce persecution and imprisonment in the British dominions,
on account of her religious opinions.</p>

<p>From Partridge &amp; Britain, New York: "An Epic of the
Starry Heaven." By Thomas L. Harris. There are undoubtedly
a great many very high poetical flights in this
volume, but really we are unable to judge of their claims
to peculiar inspiration or spirituality. We must leave
those claims, which we find enforced in the introduction,
to the decision of the "spiritualists," with whose peculiar
tests we have not yet become familiar.</p>

her merits. 'Permit me to write the songs of
my country, and I care not who makes her laws,' said one
who understood human nature, and I would hope through
your instrumentality the name of my good ship will become
a household word.</p>

<p>O<span class="smcapa">NE</span> W<span class="smcapa">ORD OF</span> A<span class="smcapa">DVICE</span>.&mdash;When a person purporting to be
a travelling agent offers the "Lady's Book" at less than $3
a year, you may set him down as an impostor. The Balt
County "Advocate" says that a person named James Rogers
has been in that neighborhood offering the "Book" at $2,
and has succeeded in getting a great many subscribers.
That is it; to save a dollar, those persons who subscribed
lost two. If you want a magazine, the best way to get it
is to send your money direct to the publisher.</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">EWING</span>-M<span class="smcapa">ACHINES</span>.&mdash;We will purchase and forward these

<hr class="r5" />

<p>O<span class="smcapa">UR</span> P<span class="smcapa">ATTERNS</span>.&mdash;Ladies do not seem to be aware that
these patterns are <em>fac-similes</em> of the originals in color, trimming,
&amp;c. At a distance, they would be taken for the garment
itself. They could be worn in a <em>tableau</em> without being
detected.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> do not doubt it, but wishing the ladies to be fully
convinced about the superiority of our fashion plates, we
will trouble them to read the following notices: The "St.
Clair Observer" says: "The colored fashion plates, and Godey
is the only man in the Union that gives them, are
magnificent and reliable." The "Fort Plain Phœnix" says:
"His fashion plate is the most exquisite one we ever saw."
The "Crescent Eagle" says: "The fashion plate is the best
that we have ever seen." The "Ohio Register" says: "Its
fashion plates are ahead of any we have ever seen." That
settles the question; if not, we have some five hundred
more notices to the same effect.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>"T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> beautiful engraving of 'Christ Healing the Sick' is
unparalleled in the history of magazine plates. Among
the crowd of readers who carelessly glance at such an engraving,
but few there are who appreciate the vast amount
of thought and labor expended by none but first-rate
artists upon it, and the consequent outlay on the part of a
generous publisher in freely offering such gems of art to
the public. The fruit of months, nay, sometimes years, of
unmitigated toil, taxing the eyes and brain, are thus laid
before and received by the masses, without a thought on
the part of the latter as to what it cost to furnish the
feast."</p>

<p>The foregoing is from the Louisville "Great Valley
Trader," a paper of immense circulation in Louisville, Ky.
How true are the remarks! To engrave the plate mentioned
would take one man, and he must be an excellent
artist, at least four months, working eight hours a day,
which are about as many hours as an engraver can work.
By the time the plate reached us it cost nearly $500. It
took four months steady work to print our edition, at a cost
of $375; the paper cost $200. To sum up, it was eight
months from the time that the engraver took the plate in
hand before we could place it before our subscribers, and
the whole cost of this one embellishment was $1,075. This
is only one item of the expense of a number of the "Lady's
Book." Our business, it will be perceived, requires us to
look ahead. Eight months is a long time to wait for one
engraving.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>C<span class="smcapa">ORRECTION</span>.&mdash;In our April number, we stated that the
price of mantilla patterns was $1. It should have been
62½ cents. We can supply patterns of all the dress articles
we publish, jewelry, and almost every article for a
lady's toilet, dress, etc. Our orders last month were very
large.</p>

<p>A. H<span class="smcapa">ART</span>, Esq.&mdash;Our friend Hart has retired from the
book business. Happy man! He has not toiled so long as
we have; but he has been more fortunate in laying up the
"siller." But will he be as happy in his retirement as we
are, quietly seated at our desk planning out new surprises
for our hundred thousand subscribers? We think he will,
as he has all the elements of happiness surrounding him&mdash;an
honest man, beloved by his friends, and respected by
all who know him; a cheerful disposition, a contented
mind, a good heart&mdash;we were going to write Hart; it
would have been as appropriate. That old south-east
corner, Fourth and Chestnut, how well we know it! We
remember Carey &amp; Lea, and Carey, Lea, &amp; Carey; E. L.
Carey &amp; A. Hart; and last, A. Hart&mdash;no, not last; it is now
Parry &amp; McMillan. Mr. Parry we have known&mdash;we will
not mention the number of years, as we believe our friend
Jesse wishes still to pass for a young man, albeit he is
married. Matters will go on well, there, under his management.
And he has an able partner in Mr. McMillan, who
is not new to the business, having been a publisher in the
British Provinces. Success to the new firm of Parry &amp;
McMillan!</p>

<p>The following remarks were made by Mr. Hart at the
Trade Sale, where, by the way, his stereotype plates sold
for $55,960, a pretty good day's work. Previous to the sale,
Mr. Hart turned to the auctioneer, Moses Thomas, Esq.,
another of our good old friends, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You, sir, were the <em>first person to introduce me into the
book business</em>, having given me a letter of credit to purchase,
at the Boston trade sale, held in 1827, when I was
but sixteen years of age, an amount of five-thousand dollars,
on my own judgment, a confidence which I have remembered
to this day; and, two years afterwards, you
were instrumental in arranging the partnership for me
with the late Edward L. Carey; and now, after twenty-five
years of successful business, <em>you</em> are about to conduct me
out of the trade, by disposing of my stereotype plates; and
I must here acknowledge my gratitude to you for those
acts of kindness and confidence extended towards a mere
boy."</p>

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> call attention to the advertisement of Boardman &amp;
Gray's Pianos on our cover. <em>We know the instruments, and

in the manufacture of pianos upon whom more reliance
can be placed than upon the gentlemen who are the
subject of these remarks. A piano is an article that very
few persons purchase more than once in a lifetime; it is
therefore the more necessary that you select a manufacturer
who is well known, and who can be vouched for&mdash;one
whose pianos have stood the test of experience. We
have been instrumental in selling a number of these instruments,
and we have yet to hear the first complaint;
on the contrary, we have been thanked for our recommendation
of the house of Boardman &amp; Gray. We give an
extract of a letter from one of our subscribers, hoping that
Messrs. B. &amp; G. may take the hint contained in it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No article you ever published possessed the hundredth
part of the money value to your readers as your article on
piano-fortes. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are every
year invested in pianos, and a large proportion of them
are not worth the cost of transportation. You have given
us precisely that kind of information we needed, and in
which we were greatly deficient. I shall shortly order one
of Boardman &amp; Gray's. These gentlemen ought to send to
Mrs. Godey one of their best pianos, and, if it were accompanied
by two hundred gold eagles, it would be only a fitting
acknowledgment of benefits conferred.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> little story you sent me reminds me of an incident
which occurred here some weeks since. A young <em>orator</em>
was declaiming loudly against the literature of the day,
and more especially 'Godey's Lady's Book.' At the conclusion
of his discourse, he accepted the invitation of a
merchant, living near by, to tea. The lady of the house, a
young bride, took occasion to place the offensive magazine,
which she has taken for the last six months, in a conspicuous
position on the parlor table.</p>

<p>"'Well,' said he, as he entered the room and seated himself,
I am really quite disconcerted to see this here.' 'Yes,
it is the magazine to which you alluded in your discourse
to-day, I presume.' 'Certainly it is.' 'Well,' said she, 'I
think, sir, that you must have been a close student of that
bad book yourself, to be so well acquainted with its contents.'
He was a little disconcerted <em>again</em>, and made no
reply. 'Now, sir, pardon me, but I should regret very
much to use my influence in obtaining the names of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
many of the most intelligent ladies of our village for a
book so pernicious in its tendency. However, I feel confident
myself that nothing will appear upon its pages which
I may not safely place in the hands of my young and only
daughter.'</p>

<p>"I have succeeded, notwithstanding the gentleman's advice,
which was perhaps only a good advertisement for the
'Book,' in getting a club of eighteen names, and may still
send you some more. Here are three.</p>

<p>"The ladies wish the back numbers. Of course, I extol
your magazine. I tell them that, for beautiful engravings,
elegant patterns, fine paper and type, excellent reading
matter, minute descriptions of the prevailing modes, and,
in short, every little matter which we ladies like so well to
know, and hear, and see, it cannot be surpassed by any
other book in the country. I have done. If any lady has
given you a longer list of names, or a more 'substantial
Valentine,' I should like to know it, that I may outdo her.</p>

have been travelling through the Western States, and I
am glad to see with what joy the 'Lady's Book' is welcomed.
I frequently had an opportunity of scanning its
contents, and was never better pleased than when once I
asked a lady to lend me her number; she looked up, and,
with a mischievous smile, asked if I was a subscriber.
Receiving an affirmative answer, she handed me the
'Book,' saying: You are welcome to read it; but I never
lend it to any one who will not <em>subscribe</em>.'</p>

<p>"I only arrived at home last week; and, on Saturday
evening, as my wife and self were indulging in a romp
with our B&mdash;&mdash;, the 'Book' was brought in. This put an
end to the romp, for my wife at once commenced examining
the patterns, &amp;c. 'See, is not this beautiful? Won't
this look pretty on Frank's sack? I wonder how Mr. Godey
manages to collect so great a variety of fashions?'
And questions of similar import followed each other in
rapid succession for some time. But at length a change
came o'er her mind: <em>with an arch and quizzing look, she
asked if I had paid this year's subscription</em>. You <em>know what
my answer was, and I know what it will be hereafter. So
here is your three dollars</em>, and much good may it do you, for
I am sure to get the worth of my money.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HERE</span> is a great deal of good sense to be found in the
"London Punch," given in a humorous guise. The following
article upon the way that many females wear their
bonnets is to be commended. We may add that <em>ladies</em> in
this city do not wear their bonnets as Punch describes them.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A W<span class="smcapa">ORD ABOUT</span> B<span class="smcapa">ONNETS</span>.&mdash;When Mr. Punch, in his fashion
reports, stated that ladies' bonnets would this season be
worn on the small of the back, he only slightly exaggerated
the reality which has come to pass. We believe that this
article of the female dress has shrunk to a proportion which
renders diminution impossible. Lightly poised upon the
remotest peak of the hirsute promontory which decorates
the head of beauty, it is calculated to arouse feelings of
wonder as to what is its practical value, and why it is worn.
Certainly, as a protection against the blasts of winter, it is
utterly worthless. If the wearers suppose that it adds one
iota to their personal charms, truth compels us to say that
they are the victims of a complete self-deception. It is
destructive to that air of modesty which every one wishes
to observe in a sister or a mother, and has a jaunty air of
effrontery. We have a trembling hope that things in this
respect will shortly grow better, for we do think that human
ingenuity cannot concoct anything uglier, nor smaller, if
resort be not had to total annihilation. These gauze monstrosities
may linger a little longer, tenaciously clinging to
the outermost frontiers of weak heads, but the good sense
of the community, we doubt not, would rather go back to
the scuttle-shaped formations that surrounded our grandmothers,
than suffer their relatives and friends to go to and
fro in the microscopic fixtures which the fashionable world
charitably calls bonnets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> following is a description of the residence of Madame
Rachel, the celebrated French tragic actress:&mdash;</p>

<p>The tragedian's dwelling formerly belonged to Walewski,
the present French Minister at London, but she has altered
and remodelled it to such an extent that nothing remains
of the original fabric except the foundation and the outer
walls. The exterior presents nothing remarkable; four
windows on a floor in front, first floor over an <em>entresol</em>, and
servants' rooms over that. Entrance by a <em>porte-cochère</em>,
like almost all French town-houses, but the gate is oak,
and the carriage-way floored with wood to deaden the sound
of wheels. Square court-yard with fountain, and ivy round
the sides. Gothic staircase elaborately carved in stone, and
mysteriously lighted from above by a dome of colored glass.
On the <em>entresol</em> an antechamber in oak; dining-room to the
left in Etruscan style, containing a splendid collection of
antique vases. Between the dining-room and kitchen is a
butler's pantry, where a richly carved oaken closet holds a
magnificent service of plate, made partly in Paris and
partly in London, and valued at $20,000, or more. All this
story is laid down with Turkey carpeting, a rare thing in
France, where the dining-rooms and antechambers of even
the finest houses have seldom anything to show but the
polished floor. On the right is a parlor opening on the
court by three windows, and commanding a fine lookout
over the neighboring gardens. The ceiling of this room is
white, the walls hung with chintz of a Chinese pattern,
large crimson flowers on a sea-green ground. Curtains,
sofas, &amp;c., to match; the rest of the furniture buhl-work,
except some fancy arm-chairs of different stuffs, silk, velvet,
and brocatel. Here is an endless collection of nicknacks,
Dresden and Sevres China, Louis XIV. enamels, ivories,
bronzes; among other curiosities a strange collection of
Asiatic weapons. There are also several valuable paintings
by Boucher, Isabey, Tony-Johannot, and other native artists
of different periods. Chinese and Japanese vases (for which
clumsy objects all the French have a weakness) complete
the picture. This parlor opens into the library in a wing
of the main building. The furniture of this room is carved
oak, the walls and ceiling draped in myrtle-green cachemire.
The tragedian's desk, richly carved and covered
with green velvet, stands on the left of the door, with a
Venetian mirror just behind it. The whole length of the
wall opposite the three windows, as well as the spaces
between the windows, is occupied by bookcases. Rachel's
library comprises about four thousand volumes, all in very
quiet bindings.</p>

<p>The second story, or the first floor over the <em>entresol</em>, is in
white wood and gilding (a usual French drawing-room
style), carpeted with purple flowers on a white ground. A
large crimson sofa in the antechamber is flanked by two
busts of Clesinger's on pedestals, <em>Tragedy</em> and <em>Comedy</em>. On
the right is the grand drawing-room, running the whole
width of the house. The panels of its walls are adorned
with groups of children and cupids, by the celebrated
painter, Charles Muller. The white marble mantel-piece
is carved with arabesque and allegorical masques. The
sofas and chairs are purple brocatel with carved gilt frames,
the rest of the furniture rosewood with bronze medallions.
The clocks, candelabras, and bracelets are or-molu of the
most costly workmanship. It is hardly necessary to say
that there is great abundance of looking-glasses; they all
bear their owner's cypher on their gilt frames. Among
other objects of art in this room is a bust of Napoleon as
First Consul, by Canova. On the right of the antechamber
is the <em>show</em> bedroom (Rachel, like many other Frenchwomen,
has a quieter one for use in the third story). The bed
has purple velvet curtains, a Turkish carpet of silk and
gold embroidery for a quilt, and a lion-skin for a foot-rug.
The furniture is rosewood, with medallions of Sevres china.
A likeness of Adrienne Lecouvreur, in <em>tapestry</em>, and a
marble bust of Taglioni, are the most conspicuous of the
works of art in which this room abounds. A secret door
near the bed leads into a little boudoir on the Chinese
style, all lacquer, vermilion, and porcelain. The dressing-room
is hung with chintz, garlands of flowers on a blue
striped ground. The walls of the bath-room are sea-green
stucco.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HERE</span> is no trifling with nature; it is always true,
grave, and severe; it is always in the right, and the faults
and errors fall to our share. It defies incompetency, but
reveals its secrets to the competent, the truthful, and the
pure.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> following we extract from the "Journal of Health":</p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">ALPITATION OF THE</span> H<span class="smcapa">EART</span> C<span class="smcapa">URED BY</span> S<span class="smcapa">ODA</span>-<span class="smcapa">WATER</span>.&mdash;A
lady, about forty years of age, had suffered for twelve
years from periodical attacks of palpitation of the heart, so
violent as to shake the bed on which the patient lay.
During one attack, feeling thirsty, she expressed a desire
for some soda-water. No sooner had she swallowed the first
draught than her palpitation left her, and recurred no
more until the period of the next attack. As soon as it
commenced, she sent for her medical attendant, and told
him what had occurred a month previously, and requested
to be allowed to try the same remedy a second time. He
consented, but, wishing to ascertain which of the ingredients
of the soda-water had relieved the complaint, he gave her
a dose of citric acid by itself. This had no effect. He then
gave her a dose of carbonate of soda, which also failed. He
then mixed the powders, and gave her some ordinary soda-water,
placing his hand at the same time on her heart.
The moment she swallowed the first mouthful, the palpitation
ceased, and recurred no more for that time. From
that period, whenever the palpitation came on, she could
always stop it by this simple remedy. It appears, from the
experiments made by medical men, that the carbonic acid
was the active element in relieving the complaint, because,
until the gas was liberated by the mixture of citric acid and
the carbonate of soda, no benefit accrued.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A F<span class="smcapa">RENCH</span> surgeon has written a discourse to prove that
the more a patient cries and groans during a surgical
operation, the more likely he is to survive it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> L<span class="smcapa">AST</span> P<span class="smcapa">ARIS</span> I<span class="smcapa">TEM ABOUT</span> F<span class="smcapa">ASHIONS</span>.&mdash;Dresses are more
costly than ever; gold, silver, and ornaments of velvet are
still adopted for full dress. For instance, a pink crape
dress, with five flounces, each flounce having an elegant
and delicate wreath formed of black velvet. These flounces,
made to diminish in width as well as in the size of the
wreath as they ascend towards the waist, are also vandyked,
the festoons being edged with a black velvet stripe. The
body has a bertha forming a point in front and behind,
trimmed with a narrow wreath, and surrounded with deep
frills in the same style as the flounces on the skirt. For
sleeves, a small puff, with a row of small velvet flowers,
terminated with two deep frills, the same as the bertha.
Another style, which is quite different, but equally pretty,
is a dress made of white <em>taffetas</em>, with three flounces, each
one trimmed with five rows of green curly plush, woven in
the material, and separated by a velvet stripe. This plush
and velvet diminish in width and change in shade as they
ascend, so that the plush and velvet are of quite a delicate
green towards the waist. The body has a bertha forming
a <em>rever</em>, and coming down as low as the waist, in a point,
both behind and in front.</p>

<p>S<span class="smcapa">TEAMBOATS ON THE</span> D<span class="smcapa">ELAWARE</span>.&mdash;The numerous steamboats
on our beautiful river were put in motion early in
the spring. They are now running, not, indeed, in fearful
and dangerous opposition, but each in its "appropriate
sphere," and competing only in the excellency of their accommodations,
and in the safe conveyance of travellers and
pleasure-parties to and from the various points which line
the shores of the Delaware from the Capes to the city of Trenton.
Among the number thus employed are the large and
handsome boats of the Camden and Amboy Company, the
John Stevens, Captain Kester, and the Trenton, Captain
Hinkle. These boats, as well as their gentlemanly commanders,
are old and established favorites of the travelling
and pleasure-seeking public. It may be said with great
truth that there is not on any route in the entire range of
the United States more safe, quiet, and punctual conveyances,
or better accommodations, than are afforded by these
boats, or officers more attentive to their duties, or more
anxious to infuse feelings of confidence and comfort among
their passengers, than are their commanders. We must
not forget, however, to do justice to the unwearied exertions
of W. H. Gatzmer, Esq., the principal agent of the
company in this city. To his zeal and watchfulness, in the
discharge of his arduous duties, the public are indebted for
many of the facilities afforded for quick and speedy travel,
as well on board the company's steamboats as on their railroads.</p>

<p>Neither should we forget our old friend, Captain M'Makin,
of the steamer Edwin Forrest, who continues his exertions
to accommodate the public with the most commendable
spirit of "competition," and who, we hope, is
reaping a just reward for his labors.</p>

a school scene: The master is about castigating
a boy, when a new scholar with his father enters. The
look of astonishment of both of them is admirably painted;
but the picture is full of incidents, and ought to be seen by
all. There are two other pictures, "Sheep in the Fold and
in the Field"&mdash;admirable productions. A new painting has
just been added by an American artist, George C. Bingham;
it is called "An Appeal to Buncombe." The principal
figure is, of course, the speaker, who appears to be stating
his "platform" to the gaping auditory grouped in varied
postures about him. The chairman is a man of prodigious
size, and is probably a portrait. The newspaper reporter is
taking down the speech, as delivered, on the top of his hat.

<p>W<span class="smcapa">HAT</span> L<span class="smcapa">ETTERS SHOULD BE</span>.&mdash;Many people, and well-informed
people too, sit down to write a letter as if they were
about to construct a legal document or government dispatch.
Precision, formality, and carefully worded and
rounded periods are considered all-essential, even though
the epistle be intended for a familiar friend. Others appear
to be writing for publication, or for posterity instead of
making epistolary communication a simple converse between
friends. Away with such labored productions! A
letter on business should be brief; to a friend, familiar and
easy. We like Hannah More's ideas upon the subject. She
used to say: "If I want wisdom, sentiment, or information,
I can find them better in books. What I want in a letter is
the picture of my friend's mind, and the common sense of
his life. I want to know what he is saying and doing; I
want him to turn out the inside of his heart to me, without
disguise, without appearing better than he is, without
writing for a character. I have the same feeling in writing
to him. My letter is therefore worth nothing to an indifferent
person, but it is of value to the friend who cares for
me."</p>

What their fathers were&mdash;what their reputation, qualities,

their mothers are usually passed over in comparative silence.
Yet it is abundantly proved, from experience, that
the mother's influence upon the development of the child's

<h5>HOUSE PLANTS.</h5>

<p class="center"><em>From Mrs. Hale's New Household Receipt-Book.</em></p>

<p>P<span class="smcapa">LANTS</span> require much light and fresh air; a light garret
is an excellent place for them; even those which will not
bear the outer air must have the air of the room frequently
freshened by ventilation, to preserve them in health. They
should not stand in a draught of air. In frosty weather,
the windows should be kept close, and at night the shutters.
In sharp frost, instead of stirring out the fire, leave
a little on retiring to rest, with a guard before it for security.</p>

<p>As a general rule, never water plants while the sun
shines. The time should be in the evening, or early in the
morning, unless it be confined to watering the roots, in
which case, transplanted plants, and others in a growing
state, may be watered at any time; and, if they are shaded
from the sun, they may also be watered over the tops.</p>

<p>The water, if taken from a well or cold spring, should be
exposed one day to the sun, otherwise it will chill the
plants. A small quantity only should be applied at a time,
that it may have the effect of refreshing rain.</p>

<p>Rain water is the best for plants; next river water;
hard spring water is the worst.</p>

V<span class="smcapa">ENTILATE</span> R<span class="smcapa">OOMS</span> <span class="smcapa">WHEREIN THEY ARE CONTAINED</span>.&mdash;Plants should have air every day in the year
to make them grow well; but this matter, in sitting-rooms,
will not, of course, be regulated for their sakes, especially
in the colder seasons. Wherever placed, however, some
attention should be paid to airing and ventilating the
rooms regularly, by opening the windows, and occasionally
the doors, in order to excite a free circulation of air. This
should be done to a certain extent every day, according to
the state of the weather, except in the time of severe frost,
when it would not be advisable to admit external air. But
at such times, if bad weather be of long continuance, the
rooms may be ventilated by means of the doors, and by
exciting a current of air in the passages or other parts of
the house.</p>

<p>In very severe frost, or in a continuation of damp
weather, moderate fires should be made for the sake of the
plants, if placed in rooms not occupied. The window
shutters should also be closed at night.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>H<span class="smcapa">INTS TO</span> L<span class="smcapa">OVERS OF</span> F<span class="smcapa">LOWERS</span>.&mdash;A most beautiful and
easily-attained show of evergreens may be had by a very
simple plan, which has been found to answer remarkably
well on a small scale. If geranium branches taken from
luxuriant and healthy trees, just before the winter sets in,
be cut as for slips, and immersed in soap-water, they will,
after drooping for a few days, shed their leaves, put forth
fresh ones, and continue in the finest vigor all the winter.
By placing a number of bottles thus filled in a flower-basket,
with moss to conceal the bottles, a show of evergreens
is easily insured for the whole season. They require
no fresh water.</p>

<h5>INSTRUCTIONS IN KNITTING.</h5>


<p>T<span class="smcapa">HERE</span> is not one art practised by ladies which is more
deservedly popular than knitting. It is so easy, requires
so little eyesight, and is susceptible of so much ornament,
that it merits the attention of every lady.</p>

<p>The first process in knitting is known by the term <em>casting
on</em>. There are two ways of doing this; with one needle
and with two. Take the thread between the second and
third fingers of the left hand, leaving an end of about a
yard for every hundred stitches; pass it round the thumb
of that hand, giving it a twist, so as to form a loop. Take
a knitting-needle in the right hand, insert the point in the
loop and pass the thread from the ball round the needle;
then bend the point of the needle through the loop, which
tighten, and one stitch will be complete. Continuing to
make loops over the thumb, with the end of thread, and
knit them with that from the ball until the proper number
is cast on.</p>

<p><em>To cast on with two needles</em> (generally called the Spanish
method), begin by making a loop on the end of the thread,
into which slip the point of one needle, holding it in the
left hand. Take the other needle in the right hand, and
slip its point into the same loop; bring the thread round
the point of this needle, and bend the needle towards you,
so that the thread forms a loop on it. Slip that also on the
left needle, without withdrawing it from the right. Put
the thread round the right again, and repeat the process.</p>

<p><em>Plain Knitting.</em>&mdash;After all the stitches are cast on, hold
the needle containing them in the left hand. Pass the
thread round the little finger of the right hand, <em>under</em> the
second and third, and above the point of the first. Then
take the other needle in the right hand, slip the point in
the first stitch, and put the thread round it; bring forward
the point of the right hand needle, so that the thread
forms a loop on it. Slip the end of the left hand needle
out of the stitch, and a new stitch is knitted.</p>

<p><em>German Manner.</em>&mdash;The thread, instead of being held by
the fingers of the right hand, is passed over and under
those of the left. The process is exactly the same.</p>

<p><em>Purling.</em>&mdash;Begin by bringing the thread in front of the
right hand needle, which slip into a stitch pointing towards
you; that is, in the reverse of the usual mode. Put the
thread round the point of the needle, still bringing it towards
you, bend the needle backwards to form a loop, and
withdraw the stitch from the point of the left hand needle.</p>

<p>When knitted and purled stitches occur in the same
row, the thread must be brought forward before a purled
stitch, and taken back before a knitted one.</p>

<p><em>To make a stitch.</em>&mdash;Bring the thread in front, as if for a
purled stitch, so that when you knit one the thread will
pass over the needle, and will make a hole in the following
row. The thread is put twice entirely round the needle,
and then brought forward, so that the next knitted stitch
will take it over a third time. In doing the next row, knit
one, purl one, knit one of these stitches; however many
are made, they must be alternately knitted and purled in
the next row. When the stitch following the made stitches
is to be purled, the thread must be entirely passed round
the needle, once for every stitch to be made, and brought
forward also.</p>

<p><em>Slip stitch.</em>&mdash;Pass a stitch from the left needle to the
right, without knitting it. There are two ways of decreasing;
first, by knitting two, three, or more stitches as one,
marked in knitting, as k 2 t, k 3 t, &amp;c. Secondly, in the
following way: slip one stitch, knit one, pass the slip
stitch over; this decreases one stitch. To decrease two;
slip one, knit two together, pass the slip stitch over.</p>

<p>A reverse stitch is taken off the left hand needle, in the
reverse way to knitting and purling. In both these, the
right hand needle is inserted in the middle of the stitch,
and the point brought out towards you or otherwise. But
to make a reverse stitch, you insert the point of the needle
in the stitch <em>at the back of the work</em>, and bring it forward
through the opening in which it generally is inserted. The
thread is to be placed round it, as for a purled stitch.</p>

<p>To reverse two, three, or more stitches together, insert
the needle in them all at once, <em>from the last to the first</em>.</p>

<p><em>To take up stitches.</em>&mdash;Insert the needle in the loop, pass
the thread round, and knit it in the usual manner. Do
not draw out any loop more than can be avoided, while
knitting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span></p>

<p><em>To knit two pieces together.</em>&mdash;To do this, there must be an
equal number of stitches on both. Hold the needles together
in the right hand, and knit as usual, inserting the
left-hand needle in a loop of each at the same time, and
treating the two as one.</p>

<p><em>To form a round.</em>&mdash;The French manner of performing this
process is by casting the whole number of stitches on one
needle, and then distributing them on three, or perhaps
four. But the English mode is to divide the number of
stitches, and cast so many on each needle, not withdrawing
the last stitch of each needle from the point of the next
needle. When all are cast on, the round is made by knitting
the <em>two first</em> stitches on to the last needle. Four
needles are employed for stockings, five for doyleys and
other round articles.</p>

<p><em>To cast off.</em>&mdash;Knit two stitches, insert the point of the
left hand needle in the first stitch, and draw it on the
other. Knit another stitch, and treat these two in the
same way.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> E<span class="smcapa">MPRESS OF</span> F<span class="smcapa">RANCE</span>.&mdash;A correspondent of the
"Morning Post," describing the appearance of the Empress
of France at a ball, says: "The grace and beauty of the
Empress were observed to the fullest advantage. Her
faultless delicacy of feature, and the elegance of her figure,
were well displayed by a very chaste costume of white lace,
ornamented with ribbons of violet color, falling half way
down the skirt. The headdress was exquisitely beautiful.
Her Majesty's hair is of a beautiful light brown tint, and
it was disposed last evening in tasteful rolls over the forehead,
leaving disclosed the ears, from which diamonds
were pendant. Her Majesty wore a diamond necklace of
marvellous brilliancy, every stone of which reflected its
myriad hues, and a pair of somewhat small bracelets <em>en
suite</em>."</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Another writer says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From some statistics of the Legion of Honor just published,
it appears that this body numbers about 52,000, or
little more than a two-hundredth part of the male population
of France. It was usually supposed to be larger; the
English used to say that every third Frenchman in a respectable
position was a 'Knight' of the Legion. In
Louis Philippe's time it was conferred on some odd subjects,
old Galignani among others, whose chief merits were,
keeping a circulating library, printing English books (before
the late international legislation on that subject), and
publishing a newspaper of selections which put in all it
can find in disparagement of the Americans.</p>

<p>"By the time a man has lived two or three years in
Paris, he generally fancies himself pretty well posted up in
French cookery; but I came across something the other
day which knocked me, and will probably astonish you too,
as it is founded on what we are accustomed to regard as a
peculiarly national comestible. Every American is acquainted
with pumpkin pie, and a good many of us like it.
But what do you say to <em>pumpkin soup?</em> Till you have tried
it, you don't know of what the vegetable is capable. <em>Purée
de Poturons;</em> it is made just like <em>Purée de Pois</em>, or any other
purée (and consequently is improved by the addition of
<em>croutons</em>), pleasant to the eye (a rich golden yellow), and
delicious to the taste."</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> M<span class="smcapa">ANNER OF</span> D<span class="smcapa">OING</span> G<span class="smcapa">OOD</span>.&mdash;When your endeavors are
directed towards doing good to an individual, in other words,
doing him service, if there be any option as to the mode or
way, consider and observe what mode is most to his taste.
If you serve him as you think and say, in a way which is
yours, and not his, the value of any service may, by an indefinite
amount, be thus reduced. If the action of serving
a man not in the way he wishes to be served be carried to
a certain length, it becomes tyranny, not beneficence; an
exercise of power for the satisfaction of the self-regarding
affections, not an act of beneficence for the gratification of
the sympathetic or social affections.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Y<span class="smcapa">ANKEE</span> D<span class="smcapa">OODLE</span>, <span class="smcapa">WITH</span> V<span class="smcapa">ARIATIONS</span>.&mdash;Who is there among
our readers who has not heard several of his favorite tunes
played with variations? And who is there that could,
when the musician got pretty deep in said variations, ever
recognize the original tune? It should be with alterations,
instead of variations. A recent writer, in the following,
justly ridicules this "variation" business:&mdash;</p>

<p>A few evenings since, I had the satisfaction of being present
at Signor Sivori's farewell concert. I was exceedingly
diverted by the performances of that clever violinist, which
also reminded me of an idea that had occasionally occurred
to me before on hearing Ole Bull, Liszt, and other professors
of musical gymnastics.</p>

<p>I perceived that the talent of these gentlemen lay principally
in executing variations on certain favorite airs;
that is, in disjointing their different portions, and filling up
the intervals with divers fantastical and eccentric movements
of their own&mdash;runs, shakes, and so forth; thus interspersing
the original music, which was expressive of
some sentiment, feeling, or state of mind, with passages
which, having no meaning at all, formed an agreeable contrast
to the melodies wherewith they were blended.</p>

<p>Now, the idea that occurred to me was that the principle
(so greatly to the gratification of the public) acted upon by
the musicians might be advantageously applied to the sister
art of poetry. I think that Shakspeare with variations
would very probably be received with great applause. The
variations, of course, should correspond in expressiveness
and intellectuality to those above alluded to. For instance,
let the line to be varied be&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"To be, or not to be; that is the question."<br /></p>

<p>The theme might first be recited entire, and then treated
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">To be or not, fiddle; to be, diddle; that, tooral; is, rooral; the question, lay.</div>
  <div class="i0">Fiddle, fiddle, iddle, iddle, tooral, looral, lay.</div>
  <div class="i0">Tooral, to be: looral, or not; lay, to be; that is, fiddle; the question, iddle de dee.</div>
  <div class="i0">To, yoddle; be, doodle; or, fol; not, dol; to, de; be, rol; that, ri; is, tol; the, lol; question, de rido.</div>

  <div class="i0">Right fol de riddy, oody, bow, wow, wow!</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Drowning men will catch at a straw; and, considering
the present declining state of the drama, I seriously recommend
the suggestion to the notice of the managers.
Its adoption will doubtless astonish the weak minds of
many, to whom Shakspeare's sense, at present too strong
for them, will be rendered more palatable by dilution.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A W<span class="smcapa">OMAN</span> was walking, and a man looked at her and
followed her. The woman said, "Why do you follow me?"
He answered, "Because I have fallen in love with you."
The woman said, "Why are you in love with me? My sister
is much handsomer than I! She is coming after me;
go and make love to her." The man turned back and saw
a woman with an ugly face. Being greatly displeased, he
went again to the other woman, and said, "Why did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
tell a story?" The woman answered, "Neither did you
speak truth; for if you are in love with me, why did you
go after another woman?" The man was confounded. We
should rather think he was.</p>

paper read a short time since before the members of the
Royal Asiatic Society in England, "that the artificial production
of pearls from the mussel-fish is carried on to a great
extent at Hoochow, in China. The fish are collected in
April and May, and are opened by children, who place a
small bit of bamboo in the orifice to keep the shells apart.
A piece of brass or bone, a small pebble, or a pellet of mud,
is then introduced, a dose of three to five spoonfuls of fish-scales,
pounded and mixed with water, is poured on, and
the stick removed. The fish are then placed a few inches
apart in ponds, the water of which is from three to five feet
deep, and which are well manured with night soil four or five
times every year. In these ponds, the fish are allowed to
remain from ten months to three years. Upon taking them
out, the shell is cut through with a fine saw, the pearl is
separated from the shell and the pellet, or other substance
within it extracted. It is then filled with white wax, and a
piece of the shell carefully attached, to conceal the aperture.
Several millions of pearls are thus produced annually,
worth from about a penny to eight pence a pair."</p>

<h4>The Borrower's Department.</h4>

<p class="center">"<em>The wicked borroweth and payeth not again.</em>"</p>


<p class="center">"<em>Md.</em>, 1854.</p>

<p>"D<span class="smcapa">EAR</span> S<span class="smcapa">IR</span>: I present myself before you this morning
another evidence of the great inconveniences sometimes
attending the borrowing system. My books have suffered
in various ways; some have had <em>rhubarb</em> (!) spilt on them,
others ink, besides being otherwise maltreated and maimed.
And now I find the May number for 1853 has disappeared,
and no trace of it can be discovered. Can't you aid me in
this emergency, and oblige me by supplying the missing
copy? Inclosed are postage stamps to the amount.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>S<span class="smcapa">TARCHING</span> L<span class="smcapa">INEN</span>.&mdash;To those who desire to impart to
shirt bosoms, collars, and other fabrics that fine and beautiful
gloss observable on new linens, the following recipe
for making gum arabic starch will be most acceptable, and
should have a place in the domestic scrap-book of every
woman who prides herself upon her capacity as a house-wife
and the neatness of her own, her husband's, and family's
dress; and, if she does not take pride in these things,
her husband is an unfortunate man:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take two ounces of fine white gum arabic powder, put
it into a pitcher, and pour on it a pint or more of boiling
water, according to the degree of strength you desire, and
then, having covered it, let it set all night. In the morning,
pour it carefully from the dregs into a clean bottle,
cork it, and keep it for use. A tablespoonful of gum-water
stirred into a pint of starch that has been made in the
usual manner will give the lawns (either white, black, or
printed) a look of newness, when nothing else can restore
them after washing. It is also good, much diluted, for
thin white muslin and bobbinet."&mdash;<em>Augusta Chronicle.</em></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> R<span class="smcapa">EMOVE</span> G<span class="smcapa">REASE FROM</span> P<span class="smcapa">APER</span>.&mdash;Scrape finely some pipe
clay or French chalk, and on this lay the sheet or leaf to
be cleansed, covering the spot in like manner with clay or
chalk. Cover the whole with a sheet of paper, and apply,
for a few seconds, a heated iron. On using India rubber
to remove the dust, the paper will be found to be free of
the grease.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>S<span class="smcapa">TRAW</span> may be bleached by putting it in a cask into
which a few brimstone matches are placed lighted. The
same effect may be produced by dipping the straw into
chloride of lime dissolved in water.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>V<span class="smcapa">ARNISH FOR</span> C<span class="smcapa">OLORED</span> D<span class="smcapa">RAWINGS</span>.&mdash;Canada balsam, one
ounce; oil of turpentine, two ounces; dissolve. Size the
drawings first with a jelly of isinglass, and when dry apply
the varnish, which will make them appear like oil paintings.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>M<span class="smcapa">OCK</span> C<span class="smcapa">REAM FOR</span> C<span class="smcapa">OFFEE</span>.&mdash;Mix half a tablespoonful of
flour with a pint of new milk; let it simmer for five
minutes, then beat up the yolk of an egg, stir it into the
milk while boiling, and run it through a lawn sieve.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O USE</span> J<span class="smcapa">EWELLER</span>'<span class="smcapa">S</span> R<span class="smcapa">OUGE IN</span> C<span class="smcapa">LEANING</span> O<span class="smcapa">RNAMENTS</span>.&mdash;Mix
it with a little salad oil, and with a small tooth-brush rub
the ornament till perfectly clean; then wash in hot soap
and water with a clean brush, and wipe dry with wash-leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A <span class="smcapa">VERY</span> pretty and economical finish for sheets, pillow-cases,
&amp;c., may be made from the cuttings of bleached
muslin: Cut one and a half inch squares, and fold them
bias, from corner to corner, then fold again, so as to form
a point, seam on to the straight side on raw edge and face
on a strip to cover the seam.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O GIVE A FINE</span> C<span class="smcapa">OLOR TO</span> M<span class="smcapa">AHOGANY</span>.&mdash;Let the tables be
washed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken out
any ink-stains there may be with spirit of salt, but it must
be used with the greatest care, only touching the part
affected, and instantly washing it off. Use the following
liquid: Into a pint of cold drawn linseed oil, put four
pennyworth of alkanet root, and two pennyworth of rose
pink in an earthen vessel, let it remain all night, then,
stirring well, rub some of it all over the table with a linen
rag; when it has lain some time, rub it bright with linen
cloths.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">INE</span> B<span class="smcapa">LACKING FOR</span> S<span class="smcapa">HOES</span>.&mdash;Take four ounces of ivory
black, three ounces of the coarsest sugar, a tablespoonful
of sweet oil, and a pint of small beer; mix them gradually
cold.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O TAKE</span> I<span class="smcapa">NK OUT OF</span> M<span class="smcapa">AHOGANY</span>.&mdash;Mix, in a teaspoonful
of cold water, a few drops of oil of vitriol; touch the spot
with a feather dipped in the liquid.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> C<span class="smcapa">LEAN</span> P<span class="smcapa">ICTURES</span>.&mdash;Dust them lightly with cotton wool,
or with a feather brush.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> C<span class="smcapa">LEAN</span> M<span class="smcapa">IRRORS</span>.&mdash;Wipe them lightly with a clean bit
of sponge or fine linen that has been wet in spirits of wine,
or in soft water; then dust the glass with fine whiting
powder; rub this off with a soft cloth, then rub with
another clean cloth, and finish it with a silk handkerchief.
Dust the frames with cotton wool.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>M<span class="smcapa">ILDEW</span> S<span class="smcapa">TAINS</span> are very difficult to remove from linen.
The most effectual way is to rub soap on the spots, then
chalk, and bleach the garment in the hot sun.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>I<span class="smcapa">NK AND</span> I<span class="smcapa">RON</span> M<span class="smcapa">OULD</span> may be taken out by wetting the
spots in milk, then covering them with common salt. It
should be done before the garments have been washed.
Another way to take out ink is to dip it in melted tallow.
For fine, delicate articles, this is the best way.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">RUIT AND</span> W<span class="smcapa">INE</span> S<span class="smcapa">TAINS</span>.&mdash;Mix two teaspoonfuls of water
and one of spirit of salt, and let the stained part lie in this
for two minutes; then rinse in cold water. Or wet the
stain with hartshorn.</p>

<p class="center">[<em>Fifth article.</em>]</p>

<p>D<span class="smcapa">EVONSHIRE</span> J<span class="smcapa">UNKET</span>.&mdash;Put warm milk into a bowl; turn
it with rennet; then put some scalded cream, sugar, and
nutmeg on the top without breaking the curd.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>K<span class="smcapa">ERRY</span> B<span class="smcapa">UTTERMILK</span>.&mdash;Put six quarts of buttermilk into
a cheese-cloth, hang it in a cool place, and let the whey
drip from it for two or three days; when it is rather thick,
put it into a basin, sweeten it with pounded loaf-sugar, and
add a glass of brandy, or of sweet wine, and as much raspberry
jam, or syrup, as will color and give it an agreeable
flavor. Whisk it well together, and serve it in a glass
dish.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>W<span class="smcapa">HIP</span> S<span class="smcapa">YLLABUB</span>.&mdash;Whip cream, as directed above; mix a
glass of brandy and half a pint of white wine with a pint of
the cream, which sweeten with sifted loaf-sugar, and grate
in lemon-peel and nutmeg; serve in glasses, and set some
of the whip on each.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>S<span class="smcapa">NOWBALLS</span>.&mdash;Beat the whites of six eggs to a froth,
sweeten them to your taste, and flavor them with rose-water.
Drop them into a pot of boiling water, in tablespoonfuls,
for a minute or two, to harden them. Make a
cream of milk, eggs, and sugar to float them in.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A F<span class="smcapa">LOATING</span> I<span class="smcapa">SLAND</span>.&mdash;Take a pint of thick cream, sweeten
with <em>fine</em> sugar, grate in the peel of one lemon, and add a
gill of sweet white wine; whisk it well till you have raised
a good froth; then pour a pint of thick cream into a china
dish, take one French roll, slice it thin, and lay it over the
cream as lightly as possible; then a layer of clear calves'
feet jelly, or currant jelly; then whip up your cream and
lay on the froth as high as you can, and what remains
pour into the bottom of the dish. Garnish the rim with
sweetmeats.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">LOATING</span> I<span class="smcapa">SLAND</span>&mdash;<em>another way</em>.&mdash;Beat together the whites
of three eggs and as many tablespoonfuls of raspberry jam
or red currant jelly; when the whole will stand in rocky
forms, pile it upon apple jelly, or cream, beaten up with
wine, sugar, and a little grated lemon-peel.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> W<span class="smcapa">HIP</span> C<span class="smcapa">REAM</span>.&mdash;Sweeten a bowl of cream with loaf-sugar,
and flavor it with orange-flower water, any juicy
fruit, or lemon or orange, by rubbing sugar on the peel;
set another bowl near the above, with a sieve over it; then
whip the cream with a whisk, and, as it rises in a froth,
take it off with a skimmer, and put it into the sieve to
drain; whip also the cream which drains off, and, when
done, ornament with lemon-raspings. This cream may be
used before it is set upon custard, trifle, or syllabub.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A T<span class="smcapa">RIFLE</span>.&mdash;Whip cream, as directed above, adding a
little brandy and sweet wine; then lay in a glass dish
sponge cakes, ratafia cakes, and macaroons, and pour upon
them as much brandy and sweet wine as they will soak
up; next, a rich custard about two inches deep, with a
little grated nutmeg and lemon-peel; then a layer of red
currant jelly or raspberry jam, and upon the whole a very
high whip. A trifle is best made the day before it is wanted.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>C<span class="smcapa">AKE</span> T<span class="smcapa">RIFLE</span>.&mdash;Cut out a rice or diet-bread cake about
two inches from the edge; fill it with a rich custard, with
a few blanched and split almonds, and pieces of raspberry
jam, and put on the whole a high whip.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="smcapa">Gooseberry or Apple Trifle</span>.&mdash;Scald a sufficient quantity
of fruit, and pulp it through a sieve; add sugar agreeable
to your taste, make a thick layer of this at the bottom of
your dish; mix a pint of milk, a pint of cream, and the
yolks of two eggs, scald it over the fire, observing to stir it;
add a small quantity of sugar, and let it get cold. Then
lay it over the apples or gooseberries with a spoon, and
put on the whole a whip made the day before.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<p>THE SICK ROOM AND NURSERY.</p>

<p>C<span class="smcapa">OLD OR</span> I<span class="smcapa">NFLAMMATION IN THE</span> E<span class="smcapa">YES</span>.&mdash;A correspondent
has met with the greatest relief from the following application:
Soak in cold spring water, for half an hour, a piece
of bread toasted brown, and then place it on soft linen rag,
one thickness, next the eye, and apply at bedtime every
night, until the inflammation is removed.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>F<span class="smcapa">UMIGATING</span> S<span class="smcapa">ICK</span> R<span class="smcapa">OOMS</span>.&mdash;The chlorine fumigation is
generally considered the best for fumigating the apartments
of the sick. To prepare it, mix together equal parts
of powdered oxide of manganese and common salt; put
one ounce of this powder into a basin, and pour on it a
large teaspoonful of water; then drop into the vessel about
thirty or forty drops of oil of vitriol, which may be repeated
at intervals for about three or four times. This will be
sufficient for the perfect exhaustion of the powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O MAKE</span> A<span class="smcapa">RROW</span>-<span class="smcapa">ROOT</span>.&mdash;To a dessert-spoonful of powder,
add as much cold water as will make it into a paste, then
pour on half a pint of boiling water, stir it briskly and boil
a few seconds, when it will become a clear smooth jelly.
It may be sweetened with sugar, and flavored with lemon-peel,
&amp;c., to the palate, or a little sherry or other white
wine may be added; fresh milk, either alone or diluted
with water, may be substituted for the water.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>A<span class="smcapa">NTIDOTE FOR</span> L<span class="smcapa">AUDANUM</span>.&mdash;Give immediately twenty
grains of white vitriol dissolved in water, and assist vomiting
by irritating the fauces with a feather; after the
stomach is emptied, give large draughts of vinegar and
water, and other vegetable acids, with coffee, brandy, &amp;c.,
constantly rousing the attention of the sufferer, until the
effects of the poison subside. Recourse may be had to this
until such time as the attendance of a medical man can be
procured.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>O<span class="smcapa">PODELDOC</span>.&mdash;This lotion being a valuable application for
sprains, lumbago, weakness of joints, &amp;c., and it being
difficult to procure either pure or freshly made, we give a
receipt for its preparation: Dissolve an ounce of camphor
in a pint of rectified spirits of wine, then dissolve four
ounces of hard white Spanish soap, scraped thin, in four
ounces of oil of rosemary, and mix them together.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>S<span class="smcapa">UBSTANCES IN THE</span> E<span class="smcapa">YE</span>.&mdash;To remove fine particles of
gravel, lime, &amp;c., the eye should be syringed with lukewarm
water till free from them. Be particular not to worry the
eye under the impression that the substance is still there,
which the enlargement of some of the minute vessels
makes the patient believe is actually the case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />



<h4>The Toilet.</h4>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>G<span class="smcapa">OWLAND'S</span> L<span class="smcapa">OTION</span>.&mdash;Take one and a quarter grains of
bichloride of mercury, and one ounce of emulsion of bitter
almonds; mix well. Be careful of the bichloride of mercury,
because it is a poison. This is one of the best cosmetics
we possess for imparting a delicate appearance and
softness to the skin, and is a useful lotion in ringworm,
hard and dry skin, and sun-blisterings.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> C<span class="smcapa">LEAN</span> K<span class="smcapa">ID</span> G<span class="smcapa">LOVES</span>.&mdash;Draw the gloves on the hands,
and then freely wash them in turpentine until perfectly
clean. Then blow into them and pin them on a line to dry.
The air will dissipate any smell the turpentine may leave.
Should this, however, not prove to be the case, a drop or
two of oil of lemon in a little water, rubbed lightly over the
gloves, will effectually destroy it.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O</span> R<span class="smcapa">EMOVE</span> F<span class="smcapa">RECKLES</span>.&mdash;Take of Venice soap an ounce,
dissolve it in half an ounce of lemon-juice, to which add of
oil of bitter almonds and deliquated oil of tartar, each a
quarter of an ounce. Let the mixture be placed in the sun
till it acquires the consistence of ointment. When in this
state, add three drops of the oil of rhodium, and keep it for
use. Apply it in the following manner: Wash the face at
night with elder-flower water, then anoint it with the
above unction. In the morning, cleanse the skin from its
oily adhesion by washing it copiously in rose-water.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>T<span class="smcapa">O PREVENT</span> H<span class="smcapa">AIR FROM FALLING OUT</span>.&mdash;Make a strong decoction
of white-oak bark in water, and use it freely. Make
but little at a time, and have it fresh at least once a fortnight.</p>

<h5>MAY FIRST</h5>

<p>is signalized, in the annals of New York housekeepers, as a
time of change.</p>

<p>Boarders go to housekeeping; old housekeepers, tired of
the wear and tear of servants and marketing, give up their
comfortable homes for the confinement of a parlor and bed-room
in some fashionable hotel or lodging house. Or it
may be that only a removal is contemplated, and Mr. Leeds
is called in to superintend the sale of furniture that has
got behind the times, like the street or square in which it
has been used, and carpets much too small for the enlarged
views of the wife of the successful merchant.
Months before, the young married people have been going
from house to house, peering into closets and dumb waiters,
measuring floors with an accurate eye, or halls by
sober, long-reaching strides, and taking the altitude of
windows for shade or curtain. They stop at Berrian's, on
their way to business, and pause before Haughwout's huge
windows of china and glass. Peterson &amp; Humphrey's carpets
are more attractive than the prints at Goupil's or the
landscapes at Stevens's. They notice the price of flour in
the morning paper, and consult about the wet linen goods
"from the Humboldt"&mdash;a cargo that would seem as inexhaustible
as the furniture of the Mayflower. By and by,
the mornings are passed at auctions, and "bargains" begin
to crowd their rooms, as heterogeneous in manufacture
as in use. All at once, they find their purchase brought
to a stand-still by lack of funds, and the house is not half
furnished. Ah, they had forgotten to make a calculation
beforehand, and purchase actual articles of necessity before
matters of luxury!</p>

<p>Now they go on as they should have commenced, cautiously
and economically; still, the kitchen and chamber
departments show reprovingly for some time to come how
they have been robbed for the sake of the parlor curtains
and mantle ornaments.</p>

<p>They should have had some good old friend, like ourselves,
to say, "Now, my dears, I like your plan of housekeeping;
you will find it the most comfortable and economical
in the end, if you will only go the right way to
work. You have made a fortunate selection in your house.
It is neither too large for your means nor your family.
How many rooms in it? How have you disposed of them?
Now take a spare scrap of paper, and write them down in
order.</p>

<p>"<em>Begin</em> with your kitchen, <em>end</em> with your parlor. Reverse
the usual plan, if your aim is comfort and not show. Only
Mrs. M. or N. will notice whether you have shades or curtains.
If your family lack comfortable bedding, or your
kitchen needful conveniences, you certainly incommode
those you care most to please. Take the kitchen, for example.
How large is it? Will you have it covered with
carpeting or oil-cloth? How many yards, and at what
price? Have you a range? If not, count the cost of stove
and boilers. How many chairs and tables? At what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
price? The dresser, and delf necessary for cooking and
servants' use." Fortunately, the lists of the furnishing
warehouses save an endless amount of thought and trouble,
especially in the matter of cooking utensils. Those
unlearned in such research will find one of them in our
answers to correspondents the present number.</p>

<p>As for the kitchen, so for the dining-room, the china-closet,
the linen-press, store-room, chambers, and finally
the parlor. Make your calculation as accurately as possible,
to come within the limit you have set yourself, remembering
in all cases to take from articles of mere adornment
or show, rather than essential comforts, and that infinite
petty mortifications and care can be saved to a house-keeper
by making plenty, not superfluity, her rule.</p>

<h5>A LESSON WORTH REMEMBERING.</h5>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HERE</span> are very few of our readers&mdash;we take it for granted&mdash;who
have not met with the little book, "A Trap to
Catch a Sunbeam." A longer story, by the same author,
has made its appearance in England, prettily illustrated by
Gilbert. The title is "Influence," neither more nor less;
and the object in view is to show the weight good or bad
influence will have on the character, even from the
nursery.</p>

<p>As most appropriate to our "Centre-Table Chat," which
unites gayeties and gravities, we give as a sample of the
new book. Speaking of the education of Cyril, its hero's
sister&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, Julia was improving in every knowledge but
one of the most important, the knowledge which a mother's
example could best have taught her, to know and
perform her mission here, the proper exercise of <em>woman's
paramount influence over man</em>."</p>

<p>There would be fewer wretched marriages, fewer dissipated,
degraded men, if this lesson were included in a woman's
education; if they were taught to feel the angel
duty which devolves on them&mdash;to keep the wandering steps
of those who are tempted so much more than they in the
paths of virtue and peace; to make them feel that in the
busy world are noise and confusion; that at home there are
order and repose; that there "eyes look brighter when
they come, that the smile of welcome is ever ready to receive
them, <em>the work, the books are ever ready to be laid aside
to minister to their pleasure</em>"&mdash;they would find amusement
then at home, nor strive to seek it elsewhere.</p>

<p>And not alone to the higher classes of society should this
be taught. It should be a lesson instilled into the minds
of all, high and low, rich and poor. Duty has seldom so
strong a hold on men as women; they cannot, they will
not, for <em>duty's</em> sake, remain in a dull, tedious, or ill-managed,
querulous home, but leave it to seek elsewhere
the comfort and amusement which fail them there; and,
when riot and revelry have done their work, the wives and
sisters who have done so little to make them otherwise are
pitied for their bad husbands and brothers.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<h5>FOR THE LOVERS OF JEWELRY.</h5>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> great Koh-i-noor diamond displayed in the English
Exhibition, and shown by a model in the New York Crystal
Palace, has a rival in one now deposited in the Bank
of England by the consignees, Messrs. Dory &amp; Benjamin,
of London. It comes from Rio Janeiro, and weighs 254½
carats, of the purest water. When cut and polished, it is
expected to surpass the Indian diamond in size and brilliancy.
It has been shown to the queen, and is the subject
of general remark in the English prints.</p>

<p>Ball &amp; Black, of New York, have still in their window
the celebrated necklace of pearls displayed at the Crystal
Palace. It consists of a single string of pure pearls, threaded
like the gold beads of our grandmothers, and about the
same size. The cross attached is of diamonds, in a rich
and tasteful setting. The pearls are of such unusual size
and purity that at first it seems almost impossible that
they can be real.</p>

<p>Necklaces are worn much more than they have been, for
full dress especially. The most fashionable and costly
style is of diamonds, and quite flat, either set in a pattern
or a single row of brilliants. Ladies who cannot afford
this costly appendage to their toilets adopt a very fine
Venetian gold chain, to which is suspended a medallion
of precious stones set with diamonds.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<h5>OUR FASHION DEPARTMENT.</h5>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>W<span class="smcapa">E</span> do not often allude to what we have done or intend
to do in this department, keeping the even tenor of our
way, and letting our chitchat speak for itself. But of late
we have noticed that other publications assume to have
been the first to give detailed directions, in addition to the
meagre description of the fashion plates at first offered to
the public. Hailing as we do from the Quaker City, we
shall "mildly remonstrate," and only assert that <em>this is
not the case</em>.</p>

<p>The present fashion editor was the first to originate the
monthly letter or record of the fleeting changes of the season,
and since that time has been engaged in collecting,
with more or less research and difficulty, from foreign
<em>journals des modes</em>, the importer, the mantuamaker, and
the milliner, such items as will be of practical or suggestive
use, and setting these before our readers in a simple, reliable
style, differing from the French raptures of the
"<em>Moniteur</em>," or the meagre descriptions of American prints,
where the fashions are a last consideration with the publisher&mdash;tacked
on, because some one else had set the example.
To us it seems as consistent with the scientific
and professedly critical character they assume, as a lady's
French bonnet would appear as the crowning-point of costume
on "a potent, grave, and reverend seignior." But we
have no quarrel with them for assuming our especial badge
as a "Lady's Book," nor are we at all particular in demanding
credit of them for our borrowed plumes; we
would only suggest that modesty might be a becoming addition
to them, and truthfulness an equal grace.</p>

<p>Now, any of our lady readers who have been invited by
friends in the country to "let them know what is worn
this season," will at once understand the time and trouble
it takes to answer such a request satisfactorily. To relieve
them from this task is what we have undertaken, at
the same time giving variety to our chat by the description
of any new manufacture, article of jewelry, fashionable
shops, furniture, etc. etc. We did not plan or even dream
of exciting emulation or envious remark, nor do we feel
the slightest malice or ill-will towards those who thus confess
their inferiority. Only, as the school children say,
"will they please to let us alone," as we do them.</p>

<h5>TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h5>

<p>"A Y<span class="smcapa">OUNG</span> A<span class="smcapa">MATEUR</span> G<span class="smcapa">ARDENER</span>" will find the following
effectual in keeping the birds from his freely planted seeds.
Mix together one pound of gas tar, quarter of a pound
brown spirits of tar, and quarter pound of melted grease.
Dip twine in this mixture, and weave it backwards and
forwards over the beds, on sticks firmly planted at the
side, a few inches high.</p>

<p>We <em>have</em> heard of "cherries without stones." Here is a
French horticultural receipt for producing them, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
have never seen tested, however: "In the spring, before
the circulation of the sap, a young seedling cherry-tree is
split from the upper extremity down to the fork of its
roots; then, by means of a piece of wood in the form of a
spatula, the pith is carefully removed from the tree, in
such a manner as to avoid any excoriations or other injury;
a knife is used only for commencing the split.
Afterwards the two sections are brought together, and tied
with woollen, care being taken to close hermetically with
clay the whole length of the cleft. The sap soon reunites
the separated portions of the tree, and, two years afterwards,
cherries are produced of the usual appearance, but,
instead of stones, there will only be small soft pellicles."</p>

<p>"M<span class="smcapa">RS</span>. L<span class="smcapa">OUISE</span> M. C." will find farina boiled in milk the
best food for an infant, next to its natural substance. It
is well to change with arrowroot, in case of sickness; but,
as constant food, it will fatten, but not strengthen the
child.</p>

<p>"M<span class="smcapa">ISS</span> J."&mdash;We do not think the acceptance of a bouquet
objectionable from any gentleman admitted to the family
as a visitor. Flowers, books, and music are the most suitable
gifts. Any article of dress or jewelry given or accepted
by persons with no other tie than ordinary visiting acquaintance,
is not in good taste, to say the least.</p>

<p>"M<span class="smcapa">RS</span>. S. D.," of Mobile.&mdash;Dress caps are of the lightest
possible description, a mixture of blonde, flowers, and ribbon.
Much blonde is used in trimming everything. The
gold and silver embroidered ribbon is only suitable for
evening, or for dress bonnets.</p>

<p>"M<span class="smcapa">ILTON</span>, Pa."&mdash;The "Dress Book" has been sent; the
directions are all practical.</p>

<p>"A Y<span class="smcapa">OUNG</span> W<span class="smcapa">IFE</span>" has our best wishes in her new undertaking.
If she is at all systematic, she will not find furnishing
so difficult as she anticipates. We subjoin the desired

<h5>DESCRIPTION OF STEEL FASHION PLATE.</h5>

<p>The unusually beautiful fashion plate of this month
gives a very correct idea of prevailing spring styles.</p>

<p><em>Fig. 1st.</em>&mdash;A dress suitable for the morning at a fashionable
country house or watering-place, or for dinner. As a
home dress, it is very tasteful and simple. The robe may
be of pink taffeta, cashmere, or mousseline, open from the
throat to the hem of the skirt, though the waist is fitted
close to the bust, as in an ordinary tight dress. This opening
is finished on each side by a double <em>ruche</em> of the same
material, the edges pinked, and is laced across by narrow
taffeta ribbon. Chemisette in plaits, with a lace frill.
Plain cambric skirt. Shawl of cambric embroidery; close
bonnet of pink taffeta and black lace, with an edge formed
of very narrow ribbons interlaced with black, to resemble
a plaid.</p>

<p><em>Fig. 2d.</em>&mdash;Walking or dinner-dress of pale green silk,
made plain and close; sleeves open and loose. Light mantle
of flounces or volants, of white guipure lace, headed by
a narrow ribbon of violet color. The bonnet is covered
with lace to correspond, and has leaves and ribbons of pale
violet crape; tied with broad white taffeta ribbon. Parasol
of violet lined with white silk.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that our styles are suited to the May
of our Southern readers, and the June wardrobes of our
Northern belles, being exceedingly light and simple, as
summer dress should always be. Readers round about us
are apt to forget that we have to be thoughtful of our far
away subscribers as well as themselves.</p>

<hr class="r5" />


<h5>CHITCHAT UPON PREVAILING FASHIONS</h5>

<p class="center">BRODIE'S MANTILLA EMPORIUM&mdash;SHADES OF FASHION, ETC. ETC.</p>

<p>T<span class="smcapa">HE</span> present promenade of Broadway extends scarcely to
the Astor, in a downward direction; the crush of omnibuses,
drays, business men forgetful of especial courtesy in their
haste, porters, and laborers, conspire to make a chaos of
confusion and discomfort below the Park which few ladies
care to adventure. The tide of shoppers sets downward
from the New York Hotel, and upwards from the Astor or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
Irving, meeting in a grand confluence at Canal Street,
where you may pat the curbstone with your gaiter from
three minutes to a quarter of an hour, watching an opportunity
to stem the current and cross to the other side in
safety.</p>

<p>Standing on this upper corner, you are in full view of
the large freestone front of 51 Canal, the mantilla establishment
of Brodie, to which we have promised to introduce
our readers.</p>

<p>At this present writing, when everybody wants a mantilla,
the graceful article of costume being considered as
needful as a spring bonnet, the lower front of Brodie's has
a most inviting prospect. It is entirely occupied by two
enormous windows and a door of plate glass; the windows
being, in reality, small Crystal Palaces for the accommodation
of two slowly revolving dames in court costume of
brocade or <em>soie d'antique</em>, bearing upon their regal shoulders
the <em>chef-d'œuvres</em> of the establishment, whether of velvet,
guipure, or taffeta, as the season represented may be.
At their feet are thrown, in apparent careless, but really
artistic confusion, other designs not less elegant and attractive.
These figures are of wax, modelled and colored
from life, and, having supported the onerous public duties
of the World's Fair, are now in the honorable retirement of
comparatively private, though by no means secluded life.
The room which you enter from the street is fitted up with
superb mirrors, ovals and pier, the central one being of remarkable
width as well as length. This is not, however,
the principal show-room, though the office and much other
business is carried on there in appropriate departments,
handsomely fitted up. The stairs, covered with velvet carpeting,
as, indeed, the whole establishment, lead you to the
second floor, pannelled with plate glass mirrors set between
the long windows, and in every place in which they
can well be inserted. The walls are covered, as below, with
delicate French paper, of white and gold, and, with the
rich carpet, a drawing-room rather than a business establishment
is suggested. Here there are piles of the most
elegant and costly styles of mantillas and scarfs, that have
given place to the heavy clothes and velvets of the just departed
season; and here is a fluttering of silk dresses, a
waving of spring garlands, as the busy crowd of purchasers
flutter back and forth, exclaiming, "rapturizing," choosing,
and trying on the profusion of styles before them. In
the centre, is a light iron railing, still white, in keeping
with the style of the rooms, over which you can watch the
proceedings of the store below, or, looking upwards to a
similar balcony, you see another story, apparently fitted
and furnished as the show-room in which you now are.</p>

<p>This is the wholesale department, of course by far the
most important of all. Ordinarily, you would have no call
to ascend the stairs; but, being this morning a privileged
visitor, you find there Mr. Brodie himself, in the midst of
his importations, designs, and manufactures, his clerks,
his saleswomen, whose patient shoulders and black silk
dresses give an additional air to the latest styles, and his
wholesale customers, for whom he is daily shipping packages,
parcels, and boxes, north, south, east, and west; but
especially south and west, where doubtless our own subscribers
will be among the purchasers and the wearers.</p>

<p>If your curiosity will carry you up still another flight,
Mr. Brodie's politeness will conduct you to a passing glance
of the work-room, occupying the floor above. It would not
be polite to watch too long the rows upon rows of girls and
women busy with the silks, laces, ribbons, and other delicate
materials of their craft; but you see that they are all
busy and comfortable, with light and good fresh air in
abundance. Yet higher! You noticed below how rich and
how abundant was the embroidery, with what precision it
was executed; here there is a row of frames, where embroidery,
the lightest and richest, is executed by those to
whom the work is not a pastime, but a regular and profitable
occupation. Here is the pure white <em>poult de soie</em> of the
"Snow-Drop," for instance, cut and ready for making up; the
design traced upon it, tacked as smoothly upon the frame as
the canvas of a picture, is stretched before the artist. The
rapid and regular movement of the needle is covering it with
the rich work that the young Southern bride will glory over,
when the all-important box&mdash;the <em>trousseau</em>&mdash;reaches her
from New York. There is, besides these frames, a large embroidery
department, situated up town, under Mr. Brodie's
constant supervision. But here the new styles are first tried,
that he may thus be able to regulate the prices of work, the
quantity of material, etc., to be given out. In preparing
for the winter season, this whole floor is filled with quilting-frames
for the mantle and cloak linings; still another
branch of female industry.</p>

<p>Some idea of the great amount of employment an establishment
like this gives to the industrious classes of the
city, may be formed from this bird's-eye view of the interior
of Brodie's. Three hundred workmen are engaged
from season to season in preparing the piles of costly draperies
we have seen, as the raw material comes in only to be
manufactured. Thus, the velvets, cloths, silks, etc., with
the lighter fabrics, and trimmings of ribbon, lace, gimp,
are imported by Mr. Brodie himself, and his designs are
furnished by leading Parisian houses, known in the pages
of "<em>La Follet</em>," "<em>La Modiste</em>," "<em>Petit Courrier des Dames</em>,"
and other journals of fashion.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, this fine building, with its costly decorations,
this immense stock of goods, these busy purchasers
and workwomen, are the rapid products of a persevering
industry and enterprise that, were the story told,
could scarcely be believed. The private history of most
successful business men is a commentary upon the proverb,
"Diligence is the mother of good-luck." Mr. Brodie's
is a remarkable illustration. His is the only establishment
in the country entirely devoted to the one branch of
manufacture; his whole time, thoughts, correspondence,
and Parisian visits centering on its improvement and success.</p>

<p>We have given time and space to the principal theme of
our "Chat," partly that our readers may see how various
are the styles of every article of wearing apparel, and how
safely they may trust themselves to a new and graceful
form, even though Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Brown do not happen
to have brought it from New York or New Orleans.
At Brodie's, for instance, each style is made up in every
prevailing shade of silk. What folly in Mrs. Jones to say,
"Green is the rage!" In a large city, nothing is the rage;
if it approaches such a culmination, it is given up in a very
few weeks.</p>

<p>As of mantles, so of bonnets. The milliner has her <em>Parisienne</em>
models, and her working materials, and employées.
No two bonnets in her show-room must be precisely alike.
So of the mantuamaker, who varies her shapes and her
trimmings to suit her material, the figure, height, or complexion
of her customer. Straw bonnets are perhaps the
most uniform of all in shape; but here, again, there is
every variety of ribbon and trimming. No two bows are
made alike. <em>City people will not submit to uniforms.</em></p>

<p>There is a general <em>style</em> in the fashions of each season,
but inflections and shades as various as its grass and leafage.
Our next "Chat," as in the April number, will be of
these, as June admits of changes that our Northern May
denies. July will claim, as usual, its watering-place and
travelling fashions, with nursery items, welcome at any
season to the busy mother of a household.</p>
